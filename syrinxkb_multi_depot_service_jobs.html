If you need to indicate that parts from service jobs have come from different depot&#39;s stock, you need to enable the “Multi Depot Service Jobs” option on the &quot;Fleet Servicing&quot; tab of System Options\Workshop. With that option enabled, you can tell the system which depot parts on the job have come from via the &quot;Depots&quot; tab on the &quot;Amend Service Job&quot; screen. <br>
