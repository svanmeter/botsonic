If you have recently installed the syrinx Version 4 client on a PC that also has “Office Home and Business 2010” installed and you are receiving the error “Failed to Connect to Database. Exiting System” error message when you first try to connect to the database, you should perform the below operation on the existing “Office Home and Business 2010” installation: <br><br>1. Go to Control Panel\Programs and Features <br>2. Right click on the Office 2010 Home and Business entry and Select “Change” <br>3. Select “Add or Remove Features” from the subsequent screen <br>4. Expand the Office Shared Features section <br>5. Select the “Not Available” option for the “Visual Basic for Applications” entry and then click “Continue”. When that process is complete, everything should be OK. <br><br>**We are not actually removing the component and it actually just gets reinstalled in a state that the Access 2010 runtime can use and then should allow the connection to the database.
