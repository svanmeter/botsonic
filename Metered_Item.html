<p>For equipment that has an hour-meter, the counter system has the capability of calculating charges based on the maximum of meter-hours used or the clock hours rented out. In order to use this feature the following rules must be followed:</p>

<p>a. Each metered item must be individually listed in the inventory. That is, to be considered a metered item the quantity must be 1.</p>

<p>b. The Item Type must be &quot;Rental Item - Hour Meter&quot;</p>

<p>c. The parameter &quot;Meter overtime&quot; on the Rates tab must be set to the number of meter hours (free) in a day, the number of meter days in a week and the number of weeks in a month before overtime charges begin. For example, if it is set to 8 hours allow per day, 5 days in a week and 4 weeks in a month then each hour over 8 in 24-hr period will be computed at 1/8 of the daily rate. Five times this amount will be allowed on a weekly rental, and twenty (20) times this amount on a monthly (4 week) rental. Another parameter % charge for meter overtime issued to determine the charge amount for any meter overtime. With a setting 100% then any overtime will be charged at the full price. A setting of 50% for example would only charge 50% of the normal rate for the overtime charges.</p>

<p>d. When a metered item is rented out, the counter person will be asked to enter the current meter reading in <u style="font-weight: bold;">tenths</u> of an hour with a maximum of 6 digits (99999.9 is the maximum). IF the hour meter has more the 6 digits, only the alas 6 digits should be entered.</p>

<p>e. When a metered item is returned, the counter person will again be asked to enter the current meter reading as above.  The program will then compute the charges based on the maximum clock hours or meter hours. If the customer is being charged extra for the meter hours, the counter person will also be informed.</p>

<p>f. The meter reading will be printed on the contract above the rental prices when a metered item is opened and when it is closed.</p>

<p>g. If you need to change the meter reading for an open item, follow this procedure:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">1. Select Modify Contract and call up the Contract</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">2. Right Click on the line # for the metered item.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">3. Select Change Hour Meter</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">4. Enter the correct meter reading.<br> </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.38;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;font-variant: normal;white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Sometimes, a meter needs to be replaced on a unit for one reason or another.  There is an option under the tools menu that is called ‘Replace Meter’.  This allows the user to enter the reading on the new meter so that the unit can begin incrementing off of that meter.  An entry in Edit History will record when the meter was replaced, who replaced it, and what the new meter value is.  The lifetime meter field will track the lifetime meter usage of the unit between both meters.  Any maintenance schedules that increment in hours or by usage will also take into account the replaced meter and calculate so that the unit still becomes due for maintenance at the proper time.  If the unit is on an open contract, the user will be notified, but ultimately, the meter on the open contract would need to be manually updated.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><img alt="Metered Item.jpeg" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DH1G&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM4u0000071BBD" style="width: 322px;height: 244px;"></img></p>
