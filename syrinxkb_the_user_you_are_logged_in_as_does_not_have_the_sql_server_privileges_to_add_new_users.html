<br>This error will occur if a user without database administration rights is attempting to add a new logon user to the system. Either log in to the system with the “sa” system administrator user and add the new logon user or grant the original user database administration rights. This can be accomplished by opening viewing that logon’s details in Syrinx SP Configuration\”Users/Logons”\Logon Users and pressing the “Set Admin” button.
