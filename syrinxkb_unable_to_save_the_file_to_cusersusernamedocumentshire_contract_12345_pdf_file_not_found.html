If you receive this error when attempting to print documents to PDF via the PDF button on the print preview window in Syrinx, this normally indicates that there is an issue with the SyrinxPDF printer that is used to create the PDF images of the documents. The SyrinxPDF printer will need to be uninstalled from “Programs and Features” (or Add/Remove Programs) in windows. You can then download SyrinxPDF installer from the following location: http://www.syrinxusers.co.uk:443/download/Non-Syrinx%20Client%20Files/SyrinxPDF.zip username: download password: c0nc3pt. Once you have downloaded the zip file, you can open the SyrinxPDF.zip folder and run Setup.exe.
