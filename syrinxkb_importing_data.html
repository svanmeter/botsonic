There are a variety of option available for mass importing data in to Syrinx. This is done in Syrinx SP Configuration\Administration\Import Data. You can then select the import you require in the &quot;Import&quot; drop down in the upper left corner of that screen and then press the &quot;Print Spec&quot; button in order to create a report detailing the fields you can import and which ones are mandatory and type of data allowed in each field. <br><br>You then have to create a spreadsheet and name the columns exactly as you see them on the print spec sheet or on the column headers on the Import Data screen with that type of import selected and then fill out all the necessary information. For example, if you were doing a basic customer import, you could construct a spreadsheet similar to the below: <br><br>Name Account No Size How heard of us? <br>ABC Tools abc001 Large Phone <br>McGovern Homes MH001 Medium Referral <br><br>Once the spreadsheet is filled out and ready, you then have to save the spreadsheet as a CSV file. You would then go back to the import data screen and browse for your CSV file via the folder icon to the right of the &quot;Pick File&quot; field in order to load the data in to the Import Data screen. You can press the &quot;Validate Only&quot; button in order check the data and make sure everything is ok. If something is not correct it will let you know in the Validation Notes column. You can either correct the information directly in the Import Data screen or you can amend your original spreadsheet and resave as CSV and then attempt to import again. <br><br>Once everything is correct you can then select the Import button and that will process all the information and update Syrinx. <br><br>**In most cases, Imports are not reversible. It is always advisable to backup your system prior to importing/updating large amounts of information via the Import Data screen
