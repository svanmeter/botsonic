<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Store Transfer Delay</span></span></h1>

<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;color: #333333;">Transfer delays are useful in providing a more accurate picture of when an item will be available in a specific store. For example, an item may be en route for 24 hours and thus the user would want it to show in item availability 24 hours after the date of the transfer contract.</span></p>

<p>To set this up go to Program Menu&gt;Configurations&gt;System Configuration&gt;Transfer Delay.</p>

<p>Select the store from the dropdown in the upper right corner. To set the delay double click in the box and set this field in hours.</p>

<p>You can also check the box “No Transfer” Which would prevent you from transferring equipment between specific locations. (For example, if the stores were located across the country and would never transfer items)</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>* Note - This will be the default time delay on a transfer contract. The Due Back Date of the item can be manually manipulated on the transfer contract.</i></p>
