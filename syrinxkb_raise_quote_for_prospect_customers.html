<br>You cannot raise quotes for prospect customers through the standard &quot;Enter Hire Contract&quot; and &quot;Enter Advice Note&quot; menus. To do this, you will need to locate the customer in the &quot;Prospective Customers&quot; screen which is accessed via the Syrinx SP\CRM\Prospects menu option. Once you have identified and opened the prospect customer record, click on the &quot;Prospect&quot; tab and use the &quot;Add&quot; button to create a new hire or sales quotation. Quotations for Prospects and standard customers can be viewed through the Syrinx SP\CRM\Open Quotes menu.
