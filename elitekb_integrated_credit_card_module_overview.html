<p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;background: white;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: &#39;&quot;calibri&quot;, sans-serif&#39;;color: #333333;">Speed up credit card payment processing and eliminate any possible errors with Point-of-Rental’s Integrated Credit Card Feature (EMV). Utilizing VeriFone® secure payment terminals, this feature removes the hassle of processing credit card transactions twice, once on a standalone credit card terminal and another in Rental Expert, and it also streamlines end-of-day settlements. By supporting EMV credit cards, also known as “chip &amp; pin” cards, transaction data is encrypted from end-to-end, providing the highest level of security. Tokenization enables you to process the card for follow up charges or refunds up to six months later. This feature requires high-speed Internet, VeriFone MX915 or MX925 credit card terminals, and at least Rental Expert version v2015. The credit card processor must be compatible with CAYAN Payment Gateway Services. </span></p>
