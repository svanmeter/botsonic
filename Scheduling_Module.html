<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This feature allows you to define the daily work schedules of your employees while giving them the freedom to view, print, email, and import their schedules into third-party calendar apps. Your employees can request time-off and swap shifts with other employees, which will alert their manager to approve or deny the request. This tool can generate all work shifts based on templates for the whole company, a specific store, shift, or employee group. Because it’s integrated with your Point-ofRental Software, you’ll have visibility to dynamically budget for flex employees such as forklift operators and drivers, or when a large staff is required for erecting tents during peak seasons. In addition, audits and reporting become a breeze</span></p>
