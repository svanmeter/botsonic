<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">**</span><span style="color: red;">Warning: Manually clearing locks WILL have undesired consequences.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> Clearing locks remove the safety checks built into the software. It is recommended that security be set to limit who has access to this option. In practice, a user should never clear locks manually; instead, you should call the support line for reference. Each time an item, customer, or transaction is accessed, the system sets a lock on that record, and only the user that sets the lock can clear it.  The locks are persistent, so even power off the server or terminals will not reset the locks.  Thousands of locks are set and cleared each day; however, there are times that a lock might not automatically clear itself.  The most common reason would be powering off the server or selecting log off from the terminal while Point-of-Rental Systems is running.  If this situation occurs, the only way to clear the lock is by selecting Clear Database Locks.  Warning!  Selecting this option removes the safety checks on the system for the current time<span style="color: #b22222;">.  Do not clear locks if someone else is modifying an item, customer, or contract that you want to modify</span>.  Unexpected results can occur if two people try to modify the same item, customer, or contract at the same time.  You must enter the owner or manager’s level password to clear locks</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">New locking features added to the program:</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #006400;">Error, someone has modified this contract since you started your changes. You will need to cancel your changes and start again.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">It means that more than one person is in modifying a contract and the only thing you can do is hit OK, and cancel out of the modification. You will never be able to get through it because someone else has already saved it.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><b>Added Feature</b></p>

<p style="background: white;font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A new column added showing if the program that set the lock is still running, allowing you to let the employee know to log back in close the program correctly.</span></p>
