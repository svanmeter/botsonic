<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Which Point-of-Rental Files are to be Backed Up?</span></span></h1>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">It is critical to back up your Point of Rental data to avoid data loss in the event of a hardware failure, a natural disaster, or a mass misconfiguration by one of your employees. Point of Rental Systems recommends doing a full server backup onsite and a “critical data” offsite backup. Point of Rental files and folders are held within the POR\ directory on the Remote Desktop Server.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p><b>Option A: Backup Entire Hard Drive</b></p>

<p>Ideally, the entire hard drive would be backed up so in the case of a hard drive failure or data corruption not only would the Point of Rental data be recoverable but any other data on your server would be recoverable, too.</p>

<p><b>Option B: Backup Entire POR\ Directory</b></p>

<p>The next best thing would be to back up the entire POR\ directory.</p>

<p><b>Option C: Backup Specific Point of Rental Files and Folders</b></p>

<p>Below are the critical Point of Rental files and subfolders. A full hard drive backup is recommended over this option</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;color: #4682b4;">Database Files</span></p>

<p>• All .MDB Files are to be backed up</p>

<p>located)</p>

<p>• POR\Backup\ folder contains many scripts that may be tied to scheduled tasks.</p>

<p>• POR\Contracts\ folder if you are saving PDF versions of contract Modifications.</p>

<p>POINT OF RENTAL SYSTEMS RECOMMENDS CHECKING BACKUP LOGS DAILY TO VERIFY THEY ARE SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING. IT IS BEST PRACTICE NOT TO HAVE PROGRAMS OR FILES OPEN WHEN BACKING UP. MAKE SURE THE BACKUP METHOD BEING USED CAN BACKUP FILES IN USE. POINT OF RENTAL SYSTEMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING YOUR BACKUP LOGS.</p>
