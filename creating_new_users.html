        <h2>Creating a user</h2>
        <p>Before creating a username for each employee, each employee must have a unique email address.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The software goes by the user emails. If an employee forgets their password and they click on the Forgot Password link on the login screen, they will be sent an email with a link to click on to reset their password. If you have more than one employee with the same address, the system will not know which userâ€™s password to change.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>You can create a new user by going to People &gt; Employees. From here, click + New Employee.</li>
            <li>Fill in the employee's Basic Information, including first name, last name, the username (we recommend the same as their email so it will be unique), and what role they will be acquiring (refer to our User Role document to see what each role can accomplish). To edit their username, just click the Edit button next to the username field. Other fields are Job Title, Default Language, and Salesperson if you want to designate this user as such.</li>
            <li>Complete the required fields within the Contact Information section, including the employee's email and phone number.</li>
            <li>Click Save. The employee/user will now receive an email with a link to verify their email address and then reset their password. This link will expire within 24 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Verification link troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If the verification link expires, the user can always click Forgot Password from the login screen, enter their username, click Request Password Reset and receive another link to reset their password.</p>
