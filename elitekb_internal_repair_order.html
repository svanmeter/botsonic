<p> </p>

<p>An Internal Repair Order is a convenient way to track the repair expense of a unit. It helps track availability to make sure a downed unit isn’t reserved unknowingly and subsequently overbooked, resulting in unhappy customers. If used consistently, it will tell the user which items tend to have high repair costs and help price the sale of a rental asset.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1. The first step is to create a “Repairs” customer. You can have as many as you want. The key must start with REPAIRS-.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>2. If an item is returned from a rental and needs repair, the user will have the option of creating an IRO after printing the closed invoice. Click on Create IRO.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders1_239x296" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbB"></img></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Step 2 illustrates creating an IRO at the closing of a contract; otherwise, skip to step 4.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>3. A new box will pop up showing all items rented on the contract with a check box. Select the broken item and click the “Proceed” button. If you are an equipment store and wish to track cost, only put one item on the IRO. If you are an event store and simply want to pull multiple items out of inventory and do not wish to track costs (like linens while they are getting washed), then you can select multiple items.</p>

<p>• When creating an IRO for a broken item, when closing the contract, the Item Key will be displayed as well as the Item Name.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">• Note – If multiple items on a contract are marked to create an IRO when closing the contract, the counter person will be asked whether they wanted a separate IRO for each item or just on IRO for all the items grouped together.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Creating an IRO from the Counter System Menu</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">4. From the Counter System Menu choose “New Contract” then “Internal Repair Order”.</span></p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders3_502x336" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbD"></img></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">5. You will be shown a list of repair customers to choose from. Since this is an IRO and you are taking the item out of service, make sure you do not select a Maintenance customer (this will not take the item out of service, it will create an internal maintenance order).</span></p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders4_821x253" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbE"></img></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">6. Next, add the item to be repaired (if you opened the IRO at contract closing the item will automatically be selected). You will be prompted to enter how long the item will be out of commission; as a rule, it is good to select one month to ensure you are not overbooking an item that has not been repaired.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If the item is a true serialized item and on an open contract, the user will be prompted if they would like to create a service call. If they do not create a service call, the IRO will be converted to an IMO to avoid putting the inventory out again and conflating the out field on the item.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is space available on the comments tab to outline the Complaint, Cause, and Correction if desired. These will print on the contract and carry over to any customer billing created.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">7. You can now add parts and labor to your repair contract. The cost associated with the parts and labor will be shown as the price and subsequently added to the repair cost in the item record. If you need to add a part that you do not carry in Inventory, click on the “Add Part Item” pull-down and choose “Special Order”.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders6._950x174" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbF"></img></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">8. You will be prompted to create your Special-Order Part. The only required field is the name, but we recommend you include the purchase price and if you use the Purchase Order Module, the Vendor. </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders7_308x329" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbG"></img></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">9.  If you have the PO module, you can create a purchase order for the special-order parts by right-clicking on the line in the processing screen and selecting Order Item (Illustrated below).</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="internal repair orders8_541x620" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHAJ&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FGbH"></img></p>

<p>10. You will see a message saying a purchase order has been added and it will give you the PO number.</p>

<p>* Note: If the purchase price of the item ordered increases, the cost of the item in the repair order will increase once the item is received. It will never decrease the cost of the purchase order drops.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>11. To track the repair progress, you can click ”Select Operation” on the contract processing screen. Point of Rental has five operations pre-set: Waiting on diagnosis, Waiting on parts, In repair, Repair complete, and Billed customer.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">12. You can add new operations by going to #9: Configuration, then Transaction Configurations, and then Contract Operations.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>13. When the equipment is fixed, you can close the IRO like any other contract and it will put the item back in service.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">From within the Internal Repair Order, you can create a Customer Billing if you find out the customer was responsible for the damage. You can click on Tools and select Create Customer Billing.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Either contract can be easily referenced from the other by going to Reports&gt;Related Contracts from the Contract Processing Screen.<br><br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size: 11pt;">Add Repairs as Improvement</b><br><br><span style="font-size: 14px;"><em>For Elite Only:</em><br><br><span style="font-variant: normal;white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="color: #404040;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Once the repair order is closed, the user will have the option to add the repair cost to the value of the item.  If the repair cost is added as an improvement, a purchase line for the value of the repair will be added to the rental asset.  It can then be depreciated.
