<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hold for Count</span></span></h1>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Overview: </span></b><span style="color: #333333;">It is necessary to sometimes stop the rent on a contract but leave it in open status for inventory and invoicing control. For example, a customer is finished using a piece of equipment and wants to schedule a pickup or you have picked up an event order and still need to count in the dishes and linen. There are three ways this functionality works in Point-of-Rental.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">* <b>Note:</b> If your rate is set to Party Formula you will use the ‘Hold for Count’ features.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">In the &#39;Event&#39; world there are numerous reasons to not close a contract immediately. If the items were not counted at the time of pickup or return, or you have items that require additional handling such as linen or dish items you would want to put the contract On-Hold. The most important reason to put a contract On Hold is to prevent an invoice from being generated prematurely. There are two types of On Hold procedures for an event store. Both will prevent an invoice from being generated; however, one will show all items available to rent immediately and the other will show them as not available until the contract is closed. Both methods have their uses and need to be managed appropriately. Which you choose will depend on how you run your business.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Hold for Count- Items are NOT AVAILABLE for rent.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">When a contract is picked up or returned to the rental store you will close the contract. From the Close Contract Options menu, you will choose &#39;Hold contract for the count&#39;.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">You will be prompted to enter a stop date and time. The program will default the current date and time, pressing enter will accept those entries.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">The items will remain unavailable until the contract is closed (once the pickup is made).</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">You can see the contract in the &#39;On Hold ‘tab in Day-at-a-Glance.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">When you are ready to fully close the contract, close it like you would any normal contract. The status will change from &#39;‘Hold’ to &#39;Closed&#39; but the hours and the due date will not change. At this point, you can add any missing or damaged items to the contract.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">You must have an item with an Item Key of &#39;HOLDFORCOUNT&#39; to put a contract on hold but still show the items available for rent. When creating the item make certain to check the boxes &#39;no print on contract&#39; and &#39;hide on the website&#39; in the options tab.</span></p>
