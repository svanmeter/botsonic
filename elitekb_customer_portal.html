<p><b style="font-size: 11pt;">Enabling Your Point-of-Rental Customers for the Customer Portal:</b></p>

<p>• Before allowing your account customers to register on the Customer Portal, you need to make sure the following is entered in your Point-of-Rental Customer Records (via File Maintenance – Customer File)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Primary Phone # (Note: The phone #, which will be the customer&#39;s user name, must be unique in order for that customer to register on the Customer Portal).</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Email address</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o ZIP/Postal Code</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Customer Web Portal enabled (under Accounts tab)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Account Customer must have at least one contract or quote. (Customers with no history will not be able to register/access the Customer Portal)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Note: your Customer Portal only supports Account Customers (“Cash Only” customers will not be able to register/access the Customer Portal)</p>

<p>• Once the above information has been entered in your Point-of-Rental Customer record, either manually “update website” or wait for your nightly auto-update before registering them on the Customer Portal (next steps)</p>

<p>• For security reasons, they will be asked to enter their email address and ZIP code as recorded in the customer record and a new password.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o If the entered email address or ZIP code do NOT match, they will get an error message and need to contact you for help.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">o Otherwise, a confirmation message will be displayed on the screen and they can now log in with their phone # and new password.</p>
