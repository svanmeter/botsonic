        <h2>Creating coupons</h2>
        <p>To get started, you must first create your coupons.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the top menu bar, hover over Pricing and select Coupons.</li>
            <li>Select the [+] New Coupon button in the top left corner.</li>
            <li>Enter the name of the coupon along with the coupon code, expiration date, and rental and/or sale discount percent or dollar amount.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Applying coupons to a contract</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To apply coupons, go to the Coupon Code section located below the Totals section in a contract.</li>
            <li>You can apply coupons by searching for the coupon in the search bar, then selecting the desired coupon or you can select Choose and select a coupon from the given list.</li>
            <li>The coupon code will appear as a line item on the contract showing the discounted amount.</li>
            <li>This amount will also show in the Totals section as Your Savings. If there is more than one coupon applied or more than one discount applied, this number will be a sum of all discounts, giving the customer a total discount amount.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Store front coupons</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Coupons can be entered in the storefront for online orders. To enable this setting, hover over Configuration in the top menu bar and select Front End Configuration. Here you will find a checkbox that allows customers to enter a coupon code on the store front.</li>
            <li>If checked, your customers will see a Coupon Code field in the bottom right corner of the Review Cart screen, above the Get Estimate button.</li>
            <li>After a customer enters a coupon code, the total discount will be applied to their total at checkout.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Reports</h2>
        <p>To see a report for coupons used, go to Reports. The report is called Transaction List Overview. The coupon will show under the Discount Name Column.</p>
