<h1><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Unified Numbering Contract Status Change</span></h1>

<p>Unified numbering will allow quotes and reservations to share the same number. It also allows a reservation to be changed back to a quote. As a contract is converted back and forth, the system simply adds or drops the “q” in the contract number. (i.e. q52000 becomes 52000 and vice versa).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: #2980b9;"><b style="font-size: 11pt;">Turning on Unified Numbering</b></span></p>

<p>With unified numbering on, the contract next numbering will change to whichever is the highest number. ex. if a quoted contract is numbered at 90,000 and the contract is 10,000, the contract will move up to 90,000. (this is necessary to avoid contract collisions). With unified numbering turned on, the contract will retain the same contract number from quote to reservation and back. The “q” is simply removed or replaced depending on the status.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;font-size: 11pt;">Changing Contract Status</span></p>

<p>You MUST access the contract through ‘Inquire’. Use ‘Change Status’ at the top and click on the appropriate status option (ie “change to quote”). The status will change instantly. If you click cancel on the bottom right of the contract screen, this will not cancel the status change. Additionally, if you previously operated without unified numbering and opt to change the status of a contract that was written before the unified option was implemented, the program will NOT allow for a contract collision and you will receive a message letting you know there is a conflict. You will be asked if you would like to create a new contract number.</p>

<p>If any operational or accounting actions have been taken on a reservation, you will NOT be able to change a reservation back to a quote.</p>

<p>The message will indicate what actions have been taken.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> - Common actions that will not allow a reservation to be converted back to a quote:</p>

<p>• Locked Reservation</p>

<p>• Applied Sub-statuses</p>

<p>• Routed in Dispatch</p>

<p>• Actioned in Fulfillment</p>

<p>• Begun prep process in Day at a Glance</p>

<p>• Logisticized</p>

<p>• Payments taken (even if refunded)</p>

<p>• Income postings</p>

<p>With the exceptions of payment posting and income postings, you can undo these things by simply reversing the process. You will be notified in an error message specifically what is preventing a reservation from being converted back to a quote.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>IMPORTANT:  After converting a quote to a reservation, you will be direct to the print screen and will not have the option to post funds to the contract. You will need to modify the contract in order to post payment.</p>
