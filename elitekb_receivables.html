<p><b>(Multi-Store)</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the many advantages of using the Multi-Store system is to centralize billing for your account customers. The customer only gets one statement no matter how many of your stores he has charged at He only has to write on check and send it to your main store. No matter which store a customer goes to, his up -to-the-minute balance and credit limit are displayed to the counter person at that store.</p>

<p>Statements may be printed at any store, however, only contracts for a remote store will print at the remote store. Contracts from all stores will print when printing statements from the main store. If you charge finance charges the finance charge will be assigned to the store running the statements and NOT the store that the over due contract belongs to. *NOTE: If you assess finance charges at a satellite store and then run statements for all stores at the main store and assess finance charges again, the finance charges for those customers would compound.</p>

<p>Income will be allocated to the store that OPENED THE CONTRACT, Payments made through ENTER ACCOUNT PAYMENTS can be done at any store but is usually only done at the MAIN STORE. However, if you allow account payments to be made at the counter then any store can make payments through the Counter System and the money will go into that store&#39;s cash drawer. If you do not want the satellite stores to make payments for account customers, make sure that the Pay Account Contracts as Counter Parameter is set to NO at each store. NOTE: Any credit on account from an overpayment will be credited to the store that made the overpayment.</p>

<p>If an account customer makes a payment at a satellite store and you don&#39;t allow account payments on the counter, then go into ENTER ACCOUNT PAYMENTS to post the payment.</p>
