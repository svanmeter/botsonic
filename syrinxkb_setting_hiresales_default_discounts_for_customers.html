If you need to set default hire sales/discounts for a customer record, you simply need to find the customer in &quot;Amend Customers&quot; which is accessed via the &quot;Customers&quot; option in the &quot;Amend&quot; area of the &quot;CRM&quot; tab in Syrinx SP. Once you have identified the customer record, you need to click on the &quot;Pricing&quot; button at the bottom of the customer record which will open the customer&#39;s pricing agreement, if they have one already, or will create a new agreement for the customer. Default Sales/Hire discounts can be added on the General tab of the agreement.Â <br><br>**You will want to verify that the pricing agreement is not a shared agreement as setting default discounts on a shared agreement will extend those discounts to all customers linked to the agreement. If there is a &quot;Customers&quot; tab on the pricing agreement screen, it is a shared agreement. You should click on the tab and verify that you wish to extend the discounts to all of the linked customers. If you do not, the customer should be removed from the shared agreement and then linked to a new private agreement. After you remove the customer from the shared agreement, you simply need to press the &quot;Pricing&quot; button on the customer record as described above and this will create a new private agreement for the customer.
