<p><span style="color: #3b3e41;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Reminders and Tasks can be an integral part of your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) process. This process is not just for the benefit of your external customers, but also to enhance internal communication within your organization.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3b3e41;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Sales Person Standpoint</b> - If you have outside salesmen, reminders and tasks are a great tool for the salesperson and management alike. Every sales call should be logged in the Call Log for the customer and a reminder created for the next sales call. When the reminder comes due and the next sales call is made, both the Call Log and the Reminder can be used to structure the sales call in a way that promotes revenue growth. Customer requests will never be overlooked or forgotten.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3b3e41;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Inventory Standpoint</b> - Creating reminders from an inventory ordering standpoint helps your business maintain efficiency and organization. We have all been there; you wanted to restock an item from your inventory, but you can’t remember what and how many, and that sticky note you wrote has somehow gone missing under the pile of papers on your desk. Gone are the days where you must rack your brain or rummage the mounds of paper just to remember. Your employees can create reminders for your purchasing manager to help eliminate inventory problems.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3b3e41;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Customer Standpoint</b> - Being timely with a customer is very important and sometimes can be the difference between winning or losing a deal. Reminders will help manage that relationship. Whether it is a follow-up call about their order, to answer a question they have, or just a call to see how their family is doing. Reminders go a long way in impressing your customers and showing them that you really do care about them. Price is important, but maintaining a good relationship is just as important</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3b3e41;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Management Standpoint</b> - Reminders allow you to keep track of what your employees are accomplishing or not accomplishing.  Reminders can be used by a manager to assign internal tasks that need to be accomplished or to check up on what an employee is doing. Some of the more important business functions that would benefit from Call Logs and Reminders are Sales, Accounts Receivable, Quotes, Repairs, etc. From an accountability standpoint, this is an invaluable tool. Gone are the days when your employees say, “No one ever told me I was supposed to do that!”</span></span></span></p>
