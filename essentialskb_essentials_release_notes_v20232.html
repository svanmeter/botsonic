<p> </p>
 

<ul><li></img> Storefront Enhancements
	<ul><li>Continue Shopping ease of use - Previously if you are adding items in the storefront, you had to scroll to the right after every item and click Continue Shopping if you wanted to add more. Now you can click anywhere on the screen and it will remove that cart slider so you can continue shopping.</li><li>No More Same Day Rentals past closing - If you have by the day rentals enabled, if the store is already closed, it will not allow your customers to make a reservation for the same day anymore</li></ul>
	</li></ul>
 

<ul><li></img> Esign Enhancements 
	<ul><li>Small Size Signature Bypass - We have all been there. Grocery Story, Department Store, or buying a house and signing your life away. ‘Sign on the electronic pad’, and we make the ugliest, smallest mark we can to get the signing over with. However, Rental Essentials does a check on the size of the signature and if it&#39;s very small it rejects it. If you are fine with less, there is a configuration setting now to bypass signature size validation.</li><li>Esign Next Signature - Your customers now have the ability to hit &#39;next&#39; after each signature. This helps if your document is many pages and the signatures are far apart.</li></ul>
	</li></ul>
 

<ul><li></img> Adding Multiple Condition Photos - We have added functionality and clarity to this process. Although we added functionality previously for desktop and tablets, it was not enabled for mobile devices. Now it is, and it’s also clear that it&#39;s 8mb per picture instead of the total of all pictures. </li></ul>
 

<ul><li></img> Show Availability on Closed Days - A while back, we had requests to remove closed days from item availability. Then afterwards, we heard from the other side that said “But we want to see availability on closed days because we work on closed days.” Now you have the best of both worlds. You can choose to see them on the calendar view, and the best part is it’s a per user setting and it will hold that setting. Now try to enjoy a day off without working.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li></img> External Customer Validation - For those of you importing customers through your own program, we have added functionality. Previously if you imported a customer that did not have all your required fields. it simply failed. Now it will bring up the customer screen with the fields missing that you can add and continue on.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Custom Menu in Horizontal format - If you use a custom menu for your storefront, the selections are always displayed on the left from top to bottom. You now have an option to have the top level items on the top from left to right.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Issue with Subrental/Vendor Phone resolved - There was an issue with doing a subrental and choosing a predefined vendor. If that vendor had a phone#, it did not work and you had to remove the phone#. We ‘fixed the glitch’</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Oversold Items overbooking - We have made a change to not show oversold sales items as overbooked for contracts in Order status. At that point the customer already has the items with negative quantity, so no need to show them as overbooked.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Availability/Overbook Enhancement (Mid Release 2/7/2023)- We have made a change to how availability and overbooking calculates. We received a lot of feedback asking us to change this. In the past, if an item was overdue, it took it out of availability for the near and distant future, causing overbooks. Our change is simple, but effective. This will keep overbookings from clogging up your “far in the future reservations” with overbooks just because something is a day or 2 late, or you just haven’t had time to pick it up yet.
	<ul><li>Overdue but due back same day - Availability will show out until the end of that business day only</li><li>Overdue due yesterday - Will be subtracted from availability for the next 7 days</li><li>Overdue due 2 days prior or before - Will be subtracted from all future availability</li></ul>
	</li></ul>
