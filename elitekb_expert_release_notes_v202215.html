<p><b>Fulfillment Speed:</b> On larger databases that handle contracts with hundreds of items, the loading time in fulfillment was often delayed. We changed how this screen loads on the back end to improve performance. Go speed racer, go!</p>

<p><b>Statement Logos:</b> It came to our attention that when statements were being run through the customer dashboard, the logos on the invoices were coming from the store of the first invoice. Now, each invoice will display the logo of whichever store it belongs to.</p>

<p><b>Translations:</b> According to Norad, Santa visits all children who believe in him. He must spend a lot of time on Duo Lingo. This time around we worked on translating certain fields in the report UI that are dynamically generated and certain reports from Accounting Inventory, Marketing, Fixed Assets, and Analysis.</p>

<p><b>Copying Images into Point of Rental for SQL Users on a Cloud Server:</b> In the past, the fairly straightforward task of copying and pasting images into item records, categories, and the logo field has been a thorn in the side of those on cloud hosted servers. We have put in the work to make this simple copy/paste function work as expected. As a bonus, we&#39;ve thrown in the ability to drag and drop images from file explorer into their intended records. *tosses confetti*</p>

<p><b>Memory Lane Monday:</b> This is a fun corner where we republish release notes from previous sprints you may have forgotten about.</p>

<p><b>Auto Import of Web Quotes:</b> Rental Hosting Users now have the option of setting web quotes to be auto imported. With this enabled, web quotes will be imported automatically just as web payments have had the ability to do. One less thing to forget on a busy Monday! To enable this feature, please reach out to Rental Hosting support@rentalhosting.com.</p>

<p><b>Create Subrental From the Contract:</b> Is creating the subrental contract after the reservation cumbersome for you? We have now added an alternative. When overbooking an item, say no when prompted to create a subrental request. Double click on the subrental field and enter the amount you wish to subrent. Now right click on the line item. Voila! You will see a new option to create a subrental right from here.</p>
