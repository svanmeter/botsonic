<br>If you are attempting to turn a prospect customer in to a standard account or cash customer via the &quot;Amend Prospect Details&quot; screen and the system is not proposing the correct customer type (cash or account), you should check the &quot;Account Requested?&quot; option on the &quot;Prospect&quot; tab of the &quot;Amend Prospect Details&quot; screen. If this option is enabled, the system will propose turning the prospect in to an account customer. If this option is not enabled, the system will propose turning the prospect in to a cash customer.
