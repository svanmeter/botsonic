If a customer&#39;s account balance/aged debt/unpaid invoice list has not been updated in Syrinx and no longer matches the values held in the accounts package, you can force the system to update this for all customers during the transfer. Normally, the system will only pull back account balance/aged debt/unpaid invoice list information if a customer&#39;s balance has changed but there are some scenarios where this information can become out of synch. To force the system to pull back this information for all customers thus refreshing the information held in the Syrinx database, you should open the transfer tool and then click the &quot;Edit&quot; button next to the company name in order to open the &quot;Configuration Settings&quot; screen for the transfer tool. Then, enable the &quot;Transfer Aged Debt on All Accounts?&quot; option on the &quot;Run Options&quot; tab of that screen and say OK to close the screen and save your change. After this is complete, run the &quot;Transfer Customer Information from AccountPackageName to Syrinx&quot; task on the transfer tool.Â <br><br>**After the task has run the &quot;Transfer Aged Debt on All Accounts?&quot; option will disable itself and it must be turned back on each time that you want to perform this process.
