This can now be accomplished by turning on unified contract numbering in Next Numbers.  With this setting turned on you will have the ability to go back and forth from reservation to quote and quote to reservation.  Q75678 will be 75678 when converted to a reservation and if moved back to a quote it will become Q75678 once again.

Dreams really can come true! </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment Location Tracking Part 2:</span><span class="span_2">  Additionally, location tracking is available to yard and warehouse staff directly from Contract Fulfillment when a more detailed view of where inventory is located while preparing items for rent. </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Item Locations:</span><span class="span_2">  Location tracking part 1 and 2 sound great, but what is a location?  Well, you define operational locations in Item Configurations and utilize them from Fulfillment by scanning items into those locations.  Here are a couple of examples that might help:  </span></p><table style="width: 100%;"><col style="width: 108px;"></col><col></col><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Linen:</b> A bag of linen was returned and scanned into the Dirty location (RFID).  As it moves through the cleaning process it might go through these locations - Wash - Iron - Bagging - Ready to Rent.  Each location could be setup with RFID readers capable of setting the new location as inventory moves through the process. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><b>Equipment</b>:  A scissor lift was returned and scanned to the Wash Bay location (barcode).  It may move to the inspection location or directly back to the Ready to Rent location.  Simply by scanning the item as it enters each location. </td></tr></tbody></table><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment Default Locations:</span><span class="span_2"><b></b> Eliminating double work, you can set the default location that an item will be updated to (i.e. Prep, Will-Call, Loading, and Transport - IN and OUT).  When a serialized/bulk serialized item is scanned through any of these 8 stages of fulfillment, the location is automatically updated.  Prep Out could default to a location of STAGED and Prep In might be DIRTY; Transport OUT could be On Rent and Transport IN might be ON TRUCK.  This is where your imagination comes into play.  </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1"><b>Fulfillment Location Based Label Printing:</b>  </span><span class="span_2">Scan a barcode or an RFID tag and generate a label to affix to your inventory.  After bagging or wrapping a linen, pass the item by an RFID antenna and out comes a label that identifies the inventory.  Barcoded items can also be scanned, and labels generated. </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1"><img alt="Release Notes" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHKp&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FHJb"></img></span><span class="span_1"><b>Fulfillment Data Filters</b>:</span><span class="span_2">  Data filters set in Contract Fulfillment will now be maintained as the user moves from contract to contract and day to day.  If you pull all deliveries first, then all will-call orders, this will be very useful. </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment Ready Status:</span><span class="span_2">  When a department marks a contract as DONE the status will now show as READY even when there are missing items (partial or complete). </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1"><img alt="Release Notes" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHKp&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FHJc"></img></span><span class="span_1"><b>Require Operator Login</b>:</span><span class="span_2">  People have always had a love hate relationship with this one.  Back office staff don’t want to enter their Operator ID more than necessary, but counter staff really need to identify themselves with every transaction, since counter terminals are shared.  This has always been a store setting which meant most people set it to be restrictive and lived with the extra keystrokes in the back office.  Well, now you can set this by terminal (Print Setup - Advanced tab) freeing your back office from the ball and chain (the Operator ID).  Now they should be able to double the revenue they generate with all their extra time. </span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1"><img alt="Release Notes" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHKp&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FHJd"></img></span><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Contract Processing Drag and Drop:</span><span class="span_2"><b></b> Dramatic pause…wait for it... maybe a mic drop?

Well, now you can also add an alias name to a customer.  Whether a customer has a legitimate name change, a name variation, or a bad guy trying to pull one over on you, using the new alias field will help your staff in finding an existing customer record.</span></p><p class="p_6"><span class="span_1"><b>Inventory Selection Screen</b>:</span><span class="span_2">  Setting default selections and columns has been a part of this screen for years.  But, it seems not everyone is aware of this nifty feature;
