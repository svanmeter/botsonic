<p><i><b>The dashboard can be viewed from Program Menu&gt;Item Availability or Counter System Dashboards.</b></i></p>

<p>Allows you to view total revenue by sales rep based on filtering by contract status, type, job site, grouping, or store location. You can look at a single sales rep or all your sales reps. For the sales reps, they can go to the dashboard and see all their pending contracts by quotes, reservations, open or closed. They can know the amount of the pending contract at a glance or create a subgroup, grouping all the contracts by status and then by Transaction Operation.</p>

<p>From the drop-down, you can select from the list of sales reps only the individual sales rep sales totals.</p>
