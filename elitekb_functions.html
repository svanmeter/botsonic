This can also be accomplished by holding down the control key on your keyboard and hitting ‘M’.</p><p><b>Delete</b>- We do not recommend using this option for customers with any history in your system. If you do choose to delete a customer with no history, it will ask you for a reason for the deletion. This reason will be recorded on the Customer Edit Listing Report along with the customer number, who deleted the customer, and when they did it. If the customer is carrying a balance, you will be unable to delete them.</p><p><b>Customer Dashboard</b>- allows you to access the customer dashboard from here.</p><p><b>Merge into different customers</b>- with the appropriate security level, this will allow you to merge two customer records. This would be useful if you created duplicate customer records or if one of your customers buys out another and takes on their A/R. When you select this on a customer, it will ask you if this is the correct record to merge, and then it will ask you which customer you would like to merge this record into. All history and contracts will be merged into the customer you select. If you do not have this option, you will need to enable the ability for your password level in ‘File and Field Security’.</p><p><b>Contract Questions</b>- allows you to add customer-specific questions for this customer, to be asked when opening a contract for them.</p><p><b>Email customer</b>- allows you to email the customer from here without having to get into a contract.</p><p><b>Enter Password Override</b>- allows you to enter a password to allow modification of fields that are restricted via password.</p><p><b>Store Credit Card</b>- allows you to store a default credit card number with the customer. When you select this option and you are credit card integrated, this will tokenize the card. This process will authorize the card for $1 to make sure it is valid and retain the token, this $1 authorization will expire in 7-20 business days (depending on the card brand). Whatever credit card number is entered here will always be the default credit card number that is used when paying a contract. If you choose to check the box “Don’t use historical numbers” in the Account tab of the customer record, the credit card information will be stored here, but it will not be used as a default card for payment.</p><p><b>Edit Job Site Info</b>- allows you to create customer-specific job sites for this customer and gives the ability to edit both general and this customers’ specific job site information. When creating a customer-specific job site, do not check the box to ‘Save as General Job Site’. Customer specific jobsites will appear at the top of the list.</p><p><b>Item Location Map (TSO)</b> - Allows you to locate and track any equipment associated with customers that are out on rent. Equipment will need to be set up under <a href="/articles/en_US/Knowledge/AEMP-GPS-Setup-1521147721" target="_blank">AEMP GPS</a></p><p><b>Customer Work Order Items</b> - This allows seeing all item&#39;s work orders in relation to the customer.</p><p> </p>
