<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Overview:  </span></b><span style="color: #333333;">As the name implies, Mobile Workforce empowers workers on a Jobsite as well as in the rental yard, capitalizing on their mobility. Not to be confused with the fully functional remote-access capabilities that have been available in Point-of-Rental for years, this module does not require full access to your company server. Many rental employees are purposely restricted from editing contracts by management; these workers tend to be drivers, yard, or prep employees whose job descriptions do not include dealing directly with Counter System to edit contracts. The Mobile Workforce Module is designed to allow those valuable employees to update contract-related information in real-time from their mobile phone or tablet without running Counter System or a remote desktop.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">This is a web-based application rather than a device-specific ‘App’. Mobile Workforce can be utilized with any mobile device, be it iPhone, Android, any number of tablet devices, or even a laptop. Taking full advantage of the touch-screen user interface of WiFi or broadband-enabled mobile devices, the module reduces what would normally be many labor and paper-intensive steps down to a few simple clicks.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mobile Workforce allows the mobile worker to eliminate the paper equation by performing tasks onsite without having to be granted full access to the company server. For example, service personnel performing maintenance on a portable sanitation unit can access the service contract from the Jobsite and scan the barcode on the unit to mark the service completed. The task is then instantly reflected in the contract, automatically noting the latitudinal-longitudinal location as well as the date/time stamp. Similarly, a driver delivering a high-reach lift to a Jobsite can open the contract from that site and take a photo of the item delivered as well as have the customer sign for it right on the device. The photo is saved as a contract attachment. The signature capture is instantly reflected in the contract, eliminating the need for the paper to be delivered back to the office and filed. In addition, if an employee is sent out to survey a site for delivery and setup, notes can be added to the contract or reservation, detailing the surface and size of the area or any other number of logistical elements.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">While these are a few examples of the ways in which this application can be used currently, our goal is to continue maximizing and enhancing this feature.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">On your Point-of-Rental server:</span></b></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Service runs to gathers any tasks that your employees have submitted via the Workforce app and pulls them onto your server.  (<u>Newly completed tasks are pulled onto your server approximately 1 minute after submission time</u>)</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">You will be able to view the result of your employee’s Workforce tasks in Counter System as a call log, Photo attachment, or reprint the signature in nearly real-time.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">You can view the transactions done by your employees here: Program Menu&gt;Override Reports&gt;WorkForce Edits Report. The report includes what was done, who did it, and where they were (assuming they have their GPS on in their mobile device).</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">The service also posts new contract and item data onto our Workforce server.   (<u>New Data is uploaded to the Workforce Server approximately every 15 minutes</u></span></p>
