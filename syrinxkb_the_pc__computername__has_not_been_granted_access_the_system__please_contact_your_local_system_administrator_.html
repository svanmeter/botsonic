<br>This is a licensing issue and means that the full number of licensed PCs has been reached on the database. The list of PCs currently holding licenses can be viewed in the “Registered PCs” screen in Syrinx SP Configuration\System Administration. If necessary, a PC can be removed from the list by selecting the name of the PC that no longer requires a license and pressing the “Remove PC” button. The new PC can now connect to the main Syrinx program and will take the free license. If all PCs in the list require a license to access the main Syrinx program, an additional license will need to be purchased. Please note that you will not be able to remove a PC from the Registered PCs list if you are connected to the Syrinx SP Configuration program with that same PC.
