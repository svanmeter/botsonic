Most customers normally use the &quot;sales stock sales summary&quot; or &quot;sales stock sales detail&quot; reports found in the “Reports” menu on the “Accounts” tab of the Syrinx program. You can then run these reports for a specific sales category if all of your fuel items were in one category or you can you run them for a specific sales stock sales number. The reports will detail the sales of those specific items during the user entered date range. <br>
