You can amend the figure that the system uses for estimating how many hours a machine is used while onhire by going to Syrinx SP\Fleet tab\Categories and then selecting the required category from the list and pressing the “Show Detail” button. This will open the amend hire category screen. From there you need to click on the “Meter Readings” tab to adjust the “Normal usage (hours)” settings as these control how many hours the system estimates the item is used per week while the item is onhire. The system will then use this value to estimate the date on which the item will reach the meter value set against a service reminder. You also might want to amend the “Show reminders as due if within next” settings as this will also control whether or not the system sees a reminder as “due” once the actual meter reading is within x number of units from reminder meter value. If you did not want the system to estimate when the meter will be due, you could simply clear out the “Normal Usage (hours)” settings and leave them blank and the system will only look at the “Show reminders as due if within next” settings to determine when a metered reminder for an item is &quot;due&quot;. <br>
