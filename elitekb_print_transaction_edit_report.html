<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;">This selection from the Program Menu is used to print a copy of all the transactions that occurred on a given day. You will be asked to enter the date to report. The transaction summary for the selected day will then be printed. Please refer to the sample TRANSACTION SUMMARY in Appendix G. This report shows each transaction for the day. The column headings are defined as follows:</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;text-indent: 36pt;"><b>Time</b> is the actual time of day that the transaction occurred.</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;">The second and third positions are only meaningful if the first position is O, C, M, or S. The second position shows the Status of the contract at the <u>beginning</u> of the transaction and the third position show the Status of the contract at the <u>conclusion</u> of the transaction. The statuses are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;text-indent: 36pt;"><b>A</b> - an adjustment transaction (modify contract 0)</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;text-indent: 36pt;"><b>C</b> - the contract is Closed but not fully paid</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;">blank - the contract is closed and fully paid (completed)</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;text-indent: 36pt;">- - the contract didn’t exist previously (i.e. Open contract)</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;">If a Credit Limit, Price, Hours, Discount, Time Out, or Due Back was overridden, a line on the Transaction Summary will be printed stating the Contract #, Operator #, type of override, and who authorized the override (i.e., the owner, manager, key counter, or none). If the price was overridden on opening a contract, the contract number will not appear. However, the contract number can be obtained by looking down through the Transaction Summary for the next entry for the same operator. This entry will probably be within a couple of lines of the Override line and it will have an MS code of O-O.</p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 5pt 0pt;text-autospace: ;">Next the <b>OPERATOR SUMMARY REPORT</b> will be printed. It will show the number of contract opens, modifies and closes for each operator.
