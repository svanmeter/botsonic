When you search for a customer, do you see the customer listed multiple times?  Are you not sure which customer is correct/active and do you need to combine one customer with the correct customer?  Let us show you how to &quot;clean up&quot; your duplicate customer records.<br><br>Essentials will now require all customer records to have a unique email address.  If you attempt to add a new customer record with the same email address, you’ll be prompted to merge your new record with the existing record or change the email address for the new record. <br> 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka00h000000HULE&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000000Jelr"></img></div>
<br>If you select the duplicate customer&#39;s record link, you can then make your changes, such as removing the email address if there is a phone number or changing the email address altogether.  Once the duplicate record is edited and saved, you will be taken back to the original customer record.

<div><br>If you click on a duplicate customer before saving your changes, you will receive a confirmation message asking if you really want to discard them.  Be sure to click Save if you want to keep this new customer.<br> </div>

<br>When you edit an existing record that has a duplicate in the system, a warning message will show on the customer&#39;s record.  <br>

<br>When you have cleaned up all of the duplicate customers in the list you click Save on either customer record , for those remaining that you are ready to &quot;Merge&quot;. You will be asked if you want to merge the customer records.  If so, you will confirm by entering the number of records you want to merge and click Merge.<br>

<div><br>If you have duplicate customer records with duplicate emails and no modifications are made, you are still able to continue working within Essentials as you always have with no interruptions. </div>
<br><br><br>If you want to have the same email address associated with multiple customers, leave the email field blank and enter the email address into the CC Email field (Advanced Mode) of the each customer instead of the main email field and enter in their phone number into the Primary Phone field. If you don&#39;t have their phone number on hand, you can enter a temporary number, such as 1234567890.  This will be to remind you later you will need to get a valid phone number.  <br><br>
