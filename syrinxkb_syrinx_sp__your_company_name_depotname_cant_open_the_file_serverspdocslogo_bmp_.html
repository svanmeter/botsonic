<br>If you receive this error when printing documents this would either indicate that the path set in the Syrinx SP Configuration program identifying the central location that contains the logo file is not accessible to the Syrinx user or the user does not have the correct windows share/security permissions to access the file. The location for graphic logos can be found on the “Graphic File” tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\Documents\Document Header. You must verify that this path is accessible to all syrinx users. You will also need to verify that the users have, at minimum, READ share and security permissions on that folder. If the user can browse and access the information in that shared location, you should also verify that the image file specified in the error message also exists in that location. Please note that the Syrinx client will interpret these paths literally meaning that if the path is set to C:\SQLDataSP\Docs\logo.bmp, the client will look for the logo file on its own C drive where this file most likely will not exist unless this is a one user system.
