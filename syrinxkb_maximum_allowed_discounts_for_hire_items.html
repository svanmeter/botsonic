You can control how much users can discount the hire rates for items in certain hire categories by adding a value to each hire category indicating the max amount that items from that category can be discounted. This value is set on the “Misc” tab of the “Amend Hire Category” screen and would need to be set against each specific category. <br><br>Users who do not have the system privilege “Prv.Front Desk.Override Max Hire Discount” in one of the roles linked to their Syrinx logon will receive the following message if the user tries to enter a value that is lower than the allowed amount either by manually adjusting the price or by adding a discount percentage greater than that amount: <br><br>&quot;The net rate entered (£xxx.xx) is less than the maximum discounted rate allowed (£xxx.xx) <br><br>They will also be issued with that same message if they try to print or confirm a contract that has an item which has been discounted at an amount greater than the defined threshold. <br>
