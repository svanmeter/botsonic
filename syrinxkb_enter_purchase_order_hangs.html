<br>When running Syrinx version 4 on certain Windows XP PCs, the system can hang indefinitely when the user tries to raise a purchase order against a supplier via the Syrinx SP\Purchasing tab\Enter Purchase Order menu. The only way around the issue at present is to enable the version 3 menus in version 4. You do not have to use the version 3 menu and can still continue to use the version 4 tabs to perform this work. A fact sheet named, &quot;Enable Version 3 Menu in Version 4&quot; that details how to enable this functionality in the version 4 client is available via the support portal in Knowledgebase\Fact Sheets\Admin.
