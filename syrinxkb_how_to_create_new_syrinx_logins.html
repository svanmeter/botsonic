<br>Log in to Syrinx SP Configuration preferably with the &quot;sa&quot; username and password but any SQL &quot;admin&quot; login will do. Go to the &quot;Users&quot; tab, select the Logon Users menu option and then press the Add User button at the bottom of this screen. When defining the &quot;Server Login Name&quot; use the &quot;add&quot; button to the right of that field - do no type directly in to the field as this will not work. Then select the roles the user should have and then press OK. The roles linked to the user can be changed after creating the account by amending the user that you just created. <br>
