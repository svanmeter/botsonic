<br>If Items aren&#39;t appearing on the items to repurchase report even though you have set a reorder level against the item. You should verify that a stock quantity has been set against that item and that the quantity in stock held against that item is not blank/NULL. The system does not assume that blank/null = 0 and you have to set the initial quantity to 0 in order for the system to take that item in to account for the Items to Repurchase Report.
