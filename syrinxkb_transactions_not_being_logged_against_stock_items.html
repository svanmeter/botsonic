<br>If you are purchasing or selling sales stock items and the qty of that item remains blank following a purchase/sale and there are no transactions listed against the sales stock item, this can happen if the quantity in stock listed against the sales stock item is blank and if the option &quot;Always log stock Transactions?&quot; has not been enabled against the depot record where those transactions have taken place. <br><br>To check if the &quot;Always log stock Transactions?&quot; option is enabled, you will need to go Syrinx SP Configuration\General tab\Depots and open the specific depot record and verify that the &quot;Always log stock Transactions?&quot; option is enabled. if it is not enabled, you should enable it if you want the system to record stock transactions against sales stock items that have a blank quantity value. With the option disabled, the system does not assume that a blank stock quantity equals zero and will not adjust the stock until a stock quantity has been entered against the stock item. <br>
