When printing Advice notes or offhire notes the system would always default to Tray 1 and not the preselected Tray2. <br>This meant the system would then give an error stating the tray had no paper but this was a manual feed tray. <br><br>We have found with the HP P2035 drivers have a known issue which usually happens if the application calls for a size/type of paper that is not in the machine, so it asks to load it in tray which does not normally contain any paper hence the error message. <br><br>The fix for this was to install the HP Universal Print driver PCL5 as this contained a fix for the issue.
