If you are attempting to run the Syrinx program on a terminal server and you receive the following message when trying to launch the program: <br><br>&quot;The file is not in the correct format for a Microsoft Access project&quot; <br><br>This occurs because the SyrinxSP and Syrinx SP Configuration program can only be opened once on any given computer. If you try to open either of these programs while there is already an instance of that program running you will receive the above message.  The same holds true in a terminal services environment. If you try to install Syrinx on the terminal server normally and try to access it from multiple client sessions, only the first client will be able to connect. Any other clients will receive the above error message when trying to log on as they are effectively trying to run the Syrinx program twice on the same computer. <br><br>Please consult the &quot;Terminal Services&quot; guide for details on configuring Syrinx in a Terminal Services environment
