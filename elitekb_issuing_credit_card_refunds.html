<p><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Issuing Credit Card Refunds</span></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Credit card refunds can be issued in the same manner of sales are captured – from Counter System and Account Payments.</p>

<p>Card refunds can be issued via Customer Swipe or Retrieve Card, but not via Manual Entry.  If you are storing historical card tokens use Retrieve Card, instead, or Customer Swipe.  This is a security feature to ensure cards are being refunded back to the card they were processed on.  If the original card is still active then there is no benefit in performing a Manual Entry refund over the Retrieve Card.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a position where you continually are required to refund via Manual Entry, then the CAYAN soft terminal might be the option for you. For more information, see the article “CAYAN Soft Terminal”.</p>

<p class="p_2"><b>Possible Refund Error</b></p>

<p><span class="span_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Sale Cap Refund</span><b>:</b> Disabling a store’s “sales cap refund” CAYAN “feature” allows rental stores to refund more to a card than they charged on a token; if this is not disabled then you will see an error stating <b>“</b><span class="span_2" style="font-weight: bold;">Error: sales cap exceeded</span><b>”</b> when you refund using <span class="span_3">Retrieve Card</span> when you select a historical token that has already be used to issue a refund.  Technically, for example, if you process a credit card transaction for $100.00, you cannot perform a ($100.01) or greater refund selecting that token. This setting is a good setting for retail, not necessarily for the rental industry. This feature should be disabled by default, but if you get this error you can request CAYAN to disable it, (888) 302-2926 option #1, or you can call our support line, (800) 944-7368.</p>
