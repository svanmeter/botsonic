In most cases this error is caused by the transfer program not finishing properly when it last ran. The issue can be resolved simply by pressing the “Clear Run Flag” button on the “Direct Transfer” tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\System Options – Accounts. This button will only appear when the transfer tool is in this state. <br>Issue can also be caused when another user is running the transfer program on their PC or if the transfer program is automatically running as a service on another PC. In these cases, the message will clear itself when the transfer tool successfully completes on the other computer. This will normally be no longer than a few minutes.
