<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">The EDI import function can be initiated upon opening a new PO. To do this, you will first need to receive a purchase order from your vendor in a spreadsheet and Save it As a CSV file (make sure and change all other file formats to CSV before importing). Once the file is saved as a CSV file, move to the C:\POR\EDI folder. &quot; C: &quot; is used here as an example and may not be the hard drive where your POR is located. </span></p>

<p style="background: white;">Once you&#39;re in Program Menu&gt; Purchase Orders, select Tools, and <span style="color: #333333;">New PO. Select your vendor and click EDI import (top of the screen). A new window will appear for the import. Select your file from the box at the top left. If your first row is a header row, then check the box that says “The first row contains header info”. Then, match the columns from your file with the drop-down boxes in the import window. Finally, click import records, then select a GL account, or leave blank for no account. This will import your file into a new purchase order. The file will now disappear from the list of files in EDI import so that you don’t accidentally import twice.</span></p>
