Your network connection to the server has been interrupted. Please exit out of Syrinx, log back on, and try the operation again. If you cannot log back onto Syrinx, please contact your network administratorÂ <br><br>This means that the Syrinx client has lost its connection with the database. The Syrinx client is very sensitive to network instability as it is constantly checking to see if the database is available by sending keep-alive requests. If one of these keep-alive requests should fail, the client will issue the network connection interrupted error message. This could be a temporary network issue in which case reconnecting to the database with the Syrinx client should be all that is required. If the issue is persistent, this would indicate that there is instability at some point in the network infrastructure. This could be caused by anything from the network cards on the client/server, the cabling connecting the PCs, the switch or router connecting the PCs, the client running over an unstable wireless network, the client connecting to the database over VPN via an unstable broadband connection. Your internal IT will need to troubleshoot the issue to try and determine the root of the network instability. If the issue is with running Syrinx over VPN on an unstable broadband link, you might wish to consider deploying Syrinx on a terminal server for remote users as an RDP connection tends to be more robust than a direct connection to the database over a VPN.
