<br>If you wish to only transfer invoices to the accounts package or to a posting file that are dated prior to a specific date, you simply need to set that date in the &quot;Post To Date&quot; field on the &quot;Accounts Transfer&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Accounts. If you are creating a posting file and if you had the main Syrinx program open while making the above change, you should close/reopen the client for it to pick up that change. After running the transfer or creating the posting file, you may want to clear the value in the &quot;Post To Date&quot;. If you do not do this, it may appear that there is nothing to transfer when someone attempts to run the transfer tool or create a posting file in future. <br>
