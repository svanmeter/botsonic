<h1 style="font-weight: bold;color: #749AB6;"><span style="color: #6495ed;font-size: 18pt;"><b style="color: #6495ed;"><b>Launchpad Contracts - BETA release</b></b></span></h1>

<p>This BETA release is the first step in a long-term project to move all contract processing to the Launchpad environment. This process will allow users on mobile devices to access these features. This BETA release does not allow for this mobile use - development is underway.</p>

<p>In this release, we have focused on contract processing for Quotes and Reservations. Subsequent releases will move toward repair contracts and then on to further contract processing features.</p>

<p>Any contracts created in Launchpad can be opened and processed in the current platform. They will be visible in Day at a Glance, Customer Dashboard, etc.</p>

<p>Feedback on this BETA release is encouraged via email: <b>teamproductus@pointofrental.com</b></p>

<p><u>Security Access to Launchpad Contracts</u></p>

<p>You can allow users to access and process contracts through Launchpad contracts using System Security (Company and Group level) and Employee security.</p>

<p>Area: Launchpad</p>

<p>Description: Access Launchpad Contracts</p>

<p>Checking the box will display the New Contract label on the right-hand File Menu while in a Customer or Item Search Dashboard.</p>

<p>While a Shared User could have access, you can set certain employees to restrict access to this feature from the Shared User terminal.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Viewing and Modifying Existing Contracts in Launchpad</u></p>

<p>Any contract written in the existing platform can be viewed in the Launchpad contract feature. When necessary, you are redirected out of Launchpad to continue with the actions you have selected which require you to be connected to your main server. Future versions will allow users to set up for mobile use where contract actions can be completed in Launchpad contracts.</p>

<p> </p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Unique Features of Launchpad Contracts</p>

<p>Modify Status: When viewing a contract in Launchpad, your ability to modify the status is based on the current status. Depending on if it is a Quote, Reservation, Open, or Closed status, you will be presented with the appropriate options.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="Elite Launchpad Beta_995x208" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK5&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GW0i"></img></p>

<p>Once you select a different status, those options will adjust. Some options will allow you to remain in Launchpad, some will direct you to the current platform to complete the changes.</p>

<p>Line Item Action options: Making changes to line items is accomplished by selecting the Action dropdown on the far right end of the line. From here, you can:</p>

<p>– Remove</p>

<p>– Update Quantity</p>

<p>– Update Price</p>

<p>– Update Due Date</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Allow Until Done Override: This allows a supervisor with higher permissions to enter their credentials once during the contract writing process and any other security checks will automatically use their credentials for permissions until the contract is saved. The user will not see if something is being overridden...it will just behave as if the user has the permissions.</p>
