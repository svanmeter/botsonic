<br>When transferring invoices to the accounts package, if the transfer tool issues a message &quot;Invalid Tax Code xx&quot;, you will need to convert the incorrect tax code to a tax code that exists in the accounts package or conversely add the tax code to the accounts package. <br><br>To convert a tax code, you should go to Syrinx SP Configuration\&quot;Accounts/Invoicing&quot;\Tax Codes and then select the incorrect code and then press the &quot;Convert Code&quot; button at the bottom of the screen. Then enter in the value for the tax code that will replace the existing code. If the new tax code does not already exist, the system will create one for you. When you press OK, all references to the incorrect code in Syrinx will be updated with the new tax code value. <br><br>**When converting to an existing tax code, the new tax code must have the same &quot;Rate&quot; as the code to be replaced. <br>
