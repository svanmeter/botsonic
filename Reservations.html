<p>You can write a reservation from one store that will be picked up at another store. This is useful if a customer calls store #1 and wants to reserve an item fro store #2. Instead of calling the other store, you can write the reservation from your store. When you select an item that i not located at your store, a warning will be given and you can decide to select the item anyway. Next you will be asked if this reservation will be picked up at the other store. If you answer yes, then this reservation will show on the other stores reservation report and all income will be assigned to the other store as well.</p>
