<br>If you do not wish to record the time spent when performing inspection jobs in Syrinx, you have to delete all of the entries from the “Inspection Hours Worked” reference list in Syrinx SP Configuration\General\Reference Lists. Once all of the values have been removed from that reference list entry, the &quot;Time Spent&quot; field will no longer appear on the &quot;Enter Inspection Results&quot; screen. <br><br>**This does not affect inspections for customer service jobs.
