Location: lbMenuEmailDialog(line 20) <br><br>If you receive this error when attempting to email documents from Syrinx, this normally indicates that there is an issue with the SyrinxPDF printer that is used to create the PDF files which are attached to the emails. You can verify that the issue is related to the SyrinxPDF printer by trying to print the document to PDF by using the PDF button in the Syrinx print preview. If this also fails with an error, SyrinxPDF printer will need to be uninstalled from “Programs and Features” (or Add/Remove Programs) in windows. You can then download the SyrinxPDF installer from the following location: http://www.syrinxusers.co.uk:443/download/Non-Syrinx%20Client%20Files/SyrinxPDF.zip username: download password: c0nc3pt. Once you have downloaded the zip file, you can open the SyrinxPDF.zip folder and run Setup.exe.</span>
