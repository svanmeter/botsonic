<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Overview</b>: The Line Item Receipt Breakout option from the Purchase Order menu is used to break a PO into two or more. This is useful when a Vendor back orders items but sends a separate invoice for each shipment. This procedure is very like Line Item Billing from Close Contract. To break out a PO you must have received and non-received items on the PO. All the items that have been received will stay on the original PO and all the unreceived items will move to a new PO. Each PO will retain the original PO number and will be followed by a sequence number starting with 1 &amp; 2. You can perform this procedure as many times as necessary.</span></span></p>

<p><b>*Note</b>: This REQUIRES a Purchase Order to have 1 or more items received and 1 or more open items.</p>

<p>1. From the Open display screen you will see Purchase Orders with Backorder in the status.</p>

<p>• Note: Line Item Breakout option will only display by right-clicking on a Purchase Order with Backordered in the status. The Purchase Order needs to have at least one open and one closed item.</p>

<p>• <b>Note:</b> the PO# in the upper right. In this case, it is #9397.</p>

<p>After answering Yes, PO #9397 will keep the received items and will add a sequence #, in this case, PO #8039 (1).</p>

<p>The new PO created will have the items not yet received and the PO number will be PO #9397 (2). Sequence #2.</p>
