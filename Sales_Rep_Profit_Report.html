<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This report would be generated for the purpose of paying commission to Sales Reps based upon the profit of sales items, rather than a % of the sale value.</span></span></p>

<p>Profit is the revenue minus the extended cost of the item. The commission percentage is being calculated based upon the percentage defined in the Commission/ Profit field within the Sales Rep record. You can find this in Configuration&gt;System Configuration&gt; Sales Reps&gt; click on desired Sales Rep&gt; Commission. There are several parameters that can be adjusted when running this report, including the ability to run the report for a single sales rep or all sales reps.</p>

<p>In the top right-hand corner of this report, you will notice a grid graphic. This indicates that if you export this report to excel, there will be additional columns visible. For this particular report, the additional fields are Item Key, Item Number, Item Name, Part Number, Serial Number, Home Store, Current Store, Category, Item Type, Vendor, Inventory G/L, Cost of Goods Sold G/L, and Income G/L.</p>
