Want to filter to all your current contracts to &#39;Collections&#39;, or &#39;Parties&#39; or whatever? Now you can.</li></ul>

They will only show up while writing contracts to that customer.</li></ul>

It is set to show the hours by default.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Customer Search View enhancement - When searching for customers while writing a transaction, the customers displayed were not the same height/width depending on how much information was entered. We have made the sizing consistent for a much better visual experience.</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Help Enhancement - We have done some really cool far out stuff with our help section. Now the icon is more visible in the upper left instead of the bottom, and there are help menu selections on some of the most common items</li></ul>
 

<ul><li>Notes for Delivery Locations Enhancement - Last update, we gave you the ability to add notes to locations that will transfer only to any contracts they are used on. We only did it for newly added locations. We went back and made it so that it also works on existing locations.</li></ul>
