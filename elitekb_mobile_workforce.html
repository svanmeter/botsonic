<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;color: #333333;">Let’s face it—many of your team members are on the move instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. Whether at a Jobsite, in the warehouse, or out in the rental yard, our award-winning Mobile WorkForce gives them access to the information they need as well as the ability to update concentrated information directly from their smartphone or tablet. With access levels granted per user, Mobile Workforce allows employees to take pictures of the equipment on-site, record the customer’s signature, clock in and out, send out delivery and pickup notifications, access dispatch routes, and much more in real-time without requiring full access to the system</span></p>
