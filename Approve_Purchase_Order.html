<p>All Pending POs have to be approved before they become an actual PO. There are several reasons why a PO would be pending. One reason is that the person writing the PO does not have PO Approval authority. Another reason is the PO exceeded the maximum allowed for that operator and would need to be approved by someone with a higher authorized amount. A Pending PO can also be written from an Internal Repair Order or a Customer&#39;s Work Order for items that are short by right-clicking on the item and selecting Order Item, the item will be added to that PO. If the vendor has no pending POs, then a new pending PO will be created. Note: When creating a PO and it’s over your approved amount or you do not have PO Approval, you can send notification while exiting to the appropriate employee for approval.</p>

<p>Once you select Purchase Order, you will by default be on the Open screen, select the Pending Tab. This will display all the PO&#39;s that need to be approved.</p>
