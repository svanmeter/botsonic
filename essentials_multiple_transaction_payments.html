        <h2>Processing multiple payments for a single transaction</h2>
        <p>Our system allows for multiple payments to be processed for a single transaction, providing flexibility for both the business and the customer.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the transaction to which payments need to be applied.</li>
            <li>In the payment section, choose to add a new payment.</li>
            <li>Enter the payment amount and select the payment method.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Splitting payments between different methods</h2>
        <p>Payments can be split across different methods, such as cash, credit, or check.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Within the transaction, select the option to split the payment.</li>
            <li>Enter the amounts for each payment method being used.</li>
            <li>Process each payment separately according to the entered amounts.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Recording partial payments</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Select the option to record a partial payment for the transaction.</li>
            <li>Enter the amount of the partial payment being made.</li>
            <li>The system will update the remaining balance accordingly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Managing payment adjustments</h2>
        <p>If adjustments are required for any payment, they can be managed directly within the transaction.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the payment details within the transaction.</li>
            <li>Choose to edit or remove a payment if adjustments are necessary.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all payment information is accurate after adjustments.</li>
        </ol>
