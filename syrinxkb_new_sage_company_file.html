If you replace your sage company file with a new company file in a different location on the computer/network, you will need to open the transfer tool and then use the &quot;Edit&quot; button in the upper right corner to access the transfer tool &quot;Configuration Settings&quot; screen. The path to the sage data can be set on the &quot;Sage 50 Accounts&quot; tab.
