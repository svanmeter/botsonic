<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Let’s face it—many of your team members are on the move instead of sitting in front of the computer all day. Whether at a Jobsite, in the warehouse, or out in the rental yard, our award-winning Mobile WorkForce gives them access to the information they need as well as the ability to update contract-related information directly from their smartphone or tablet. With access levels granted per user, Mobile Workforce allows employees to take pictures of the equipment on-site, record the customer’s signature, clock in and out, send out delivery and pickup notifications, access dispatch routes, and much more in real-time without requiring full access to the system</span></p>
