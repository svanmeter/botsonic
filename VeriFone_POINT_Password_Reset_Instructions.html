        <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://corporateportal.vfipayna.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #1155CC;">https://corporateportal.vfipayna.com/</span></a> - this is our reseller account. You would only need to access this account if you need to reset a customer’s password for their MC account.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Resller ID: 839</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">User ID: Padmin2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Password: (our standard format)$87 (CURRENT AS OF 8/27/2020) Please ask if you are not aware of the standard password format.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Search for your customer and highlight them, then click on Reset Password on the left.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next you go to <a href="https://storeportal.vfipayna.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #1155CC;">https://storeportal.vfipayna.com/</span></a> - this will allow you to log into their account using the temporary password you just created. You will be prompted to create a new password. You can create one using our standard format, or the customer can create one if you have them on the phone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You will need their VeriFone Merchant Account number, which you can get when you reset the password or you should also be able to get it from their Credit Card Inquiry screen. This is the long 14 character Payware Connect Merchant ID.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Be cautious when doing this, that you have the correct customer account. We have a lot of A to Z’s, a lot of Taylor Rentals and a lot of Grand Rental Station accounts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have reset the password, log it in a NOTE on the customer&#39;s asset. This will expedite if another support agent needs to get logged in to review the customers credit card transactions or force a settlement. This should be a separate case from the one you are working for the customer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The Note should be labeled Payware Connect and the detail should only contain the VeriFone Merchant Account number and the change to the password (ex: $XX).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you are helping a customer get logged in so that they can update their payment information, their steps to do that are: Go to Account Admin, select Account Info. Scroll down to the billing information and click on Edit. Once they have updated their information, they must hit save, then all the way at the bottom right they must hit update. They will get a red note in the bottom center that says Account Updated when completed.</p>
