<p style="background: white;"><br><strong>Here&#39;s how to get there:</strong></p>

<p style="background: white;"><em>Expert: Program Menu &gt; #9 Configurations &gt; System Configurations &gt; Parameters &gt; Printing tab<br>Elite: Gear icon &gt; App Configurations &gt; System Configurations &gt; Parameters &gt; Printing tab</em><br> </p>

<p>The selections for the printing tab are as followed:</p>

<p><b>Default Printing Language</b>- This is where the default language for printing is set on a store level.</p>

<p><b>Contract Copies Default</b> – These parameters allow you to set the default contract copies to print based on customer payment type (account or cash) and status of the contract (Reservation, Open, Closed, etc.). Enter in the default value for each option.</p>

<p><b>Save Contract Modifications to the Hard Drive</b> – This parameter will save a cop of every modification made to every contract on the hard drive in a PDF format. The PDF copy can be accessed by double clicking on the modification under the Transaction Edit screen in File Maintenance or Counter System.</p>

<p><b>Saved Quote Contracts to Transaction History</b> –This parameter will save expired quotes to the Transaction History. With this unchecked, all quotes will be automatically deleted when they expire.</p>

<p><b>Print New Customer Letter</b> –This parameter will turn off the printing of the New Customer Letter that prints each time a new customer is added to the database.</p>

<p><b>Print Tax Exempt Letter</b> –This parameter will turn off the printing of the Tax-Exempt Letter that print search time a tax-exempt contract is printed. If all the tax amounts for a certain tax jurisdiction are set to zero, then no tax will be changed and the Tax-Exempt Letter will not print regardless of this parameter.</p>

<p><b>Ask to print instructions</b> – This parameter sets whether to ask the counter person if instructions are to be printed every time an instruction file would normally be printed.</p>

<p><b>Regular pay hours in a day</b> –This parameter sets how many worked hours a day are regular pay hours. In most states, this would be set to 24 hours: however, California pays employees overtime for any hours over 8 worked in a day.</p>

<p><b>Non-double times pay hours in a day</b> – This parameter sets how many regular and overtime hours there are in a day before double time starts. Set this to 24 to never figure double time. Many states require double time after 12 hours worked in one day. If this is the case, enter 12 in parameter.</p>

<p><b>Regular pay hours in a week</b> – This parameter sets how many hours are regular pay hours in a week. This would normally be set to 40 hours</p>

<p>*Note-Default copies can be set to zero in parameters and will auto set in this screen. This is useful for companies going paperless with eSign.</p>
