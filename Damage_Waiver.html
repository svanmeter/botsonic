<p>There are several different ways to assign damage waiver: on the item level, on the customer level, and on the contract level. These are percentage-based.</p>

<p>The default damage waiver is set on the item level. This can be done on an item by item basis or en mass using ‘Mass Database Update’ within the Data Management Module. If there is an item you do not wish to charge damage waiver on, simply leave this field blank.</p>

<p>If the customer receives a damage waiver other than what is the default, this is defined on the Pricing tab of the Customer itself. The customer can also be marked as a damage waiver exempt here.</p>

<p>Lastly, damage waiver can be assigned on a line item basis on the contract itself if circumstances require the default on either the item or the customer to be overwritten. In order to do this, the damage waiver column must be shown on the contract. While in the contract processing screen, right-click on the blue column tab. Check the box next to the damage waiver and move it if desired before hitting ‘Save’.</p>

<p>Double click on the damage waiver percentage on the line item to change it. If it is password protected, the user will have to have the appropriate level of the password. This can be changed in File and Field Security&gt;Transaction File&gt;Dmg Wvr.</p>

<p><b>*Note:</b> Damage waiver can only be set up to 30% on the contract line item level.</p>

<p>The damage waiver can be removed entirely by unchecking the box at the top of the contract. This security is held in File and Field security&gt;Transaction File&gt;DW Exempt.</p>
