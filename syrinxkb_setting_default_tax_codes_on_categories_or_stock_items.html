<br>If you are trying to set a tax code against a hire/sales category or against a hire/sales stock item and are receiving a message similar to the following: <br><br>You may only set the category’s default tax code to a non-standard tax rate. If the sales items in this category are subject to standard tax, then leave blank. <br><br>This means that you can leave the tax code blank on the category or item and it will use the default tax code set in the system on the &quot;Tax Codes&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Accounts. You only need to set specific tax codes against categories or stock items if they require something other than the default tax code. <br><br>For example: 5% tax for fuel or 0% tax for safety equipment <br><br><br>
