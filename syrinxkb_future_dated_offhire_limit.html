If you attempt to print or confirm an offhire and the system issues the message, &quot;The Off Hire Date cannot be this far in the future!!!&quot;, this means that your system has been set to not allow offhires dated greater than a specific number of days in to the future. You can alter this setting via the &quot;Future Off-Hires Limit&quot; setting on the &quot;Off Hires&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Hire Contracts. Users may have to log out and then back in to Syrinx SP for this change to take effect.
