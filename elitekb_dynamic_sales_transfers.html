<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;">Dynamic Sales Transfers</span></h1>

<p>This feature makes it easy to create a transfer for restocking bulk sales items between stores. Your bulk serialized sales items must have a header and min/max reorders set up on the options tab. When the transfer contract is written, the system will provide a list of available items that can be transferred from one store to another to satisfy items that are below their minimum at the receiving store. It will not allow the sending store to go below its minimum in the process. It will also exclude items that are on a future transfer reservation to the receiving store.</p>

<p>Select the store the items are being transferred to and the date of the transfer.</p>

<p>Once in the contract, exit the Inventory selection screen and click on the ‘Tools’ drop-down menu at the top left of the contract</p>
