If you wish to change an item&#39;s stock number or move an item in to a different hire category, you will need to use the &quot;Renumber&quot; option on the &quot;Fleet&quot; tab of Syrinx SP as these details cannot be amended directly on the stock item record. You simply need to enter in the stock number and then press tab or return and then either enter in a new stock number for the item in the &quot;New Stock No.&quot; field or select a new hire category from the &quot;New Category:&quot; dropdown and then press &quot;OK&quot; to complete the process. If you have a large number of items to renumber/reclassify this can be accomplished via the &quot;Stock Renumber/Reclassify&quot; option in Syrinx SP Configuration\Administration\Import Data.
