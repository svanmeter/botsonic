If you accidentally delete a fixed asset record for a hire stock item record, you can recreate the fixed asset record by clicking the button next to the item&#39;s purchase date on the &quot;Accounts&quot; tab of the item&#39;s record when accessed through Syrinx SP\Fleet\Amend and then responding &quot;Yes&quot; to the prompt &quot;This stock item does not have an associated fixed asset, do you want to create one?&quot; <br>
