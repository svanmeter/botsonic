<h2><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Home location vs. Current location and its effects on the Item record.</b></h2>

<p>1. An item’s home location is the store that the item was purchased into and where the inventory value is held in the Equipment Asset Account. Additionally, this is the store that the expense and the depreciation will be calculated. If an item has a home location designated as 001, then 001 is the owning location of that item.</p>

<p>2. If the item’s current location is 002 and the home location is 001, 002 is the location where the item is currently and the purchase history for the item is still associated with 001.</p>

<p>3. When transferring an item from 001 to 002, 001 is still the owning location of the purchase no matter that the item has been transferred to 002 the home location remains 001.</p>

<p>4. We do not recommend changing the home location of an item.</p>
