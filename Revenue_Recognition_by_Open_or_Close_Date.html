<p> </p>

<p>Independent of the actual posting dates, revenue can be recognized on another date for integrated, real time accounting postings. This allows the user to recognize income in one month, even if the contract is not actually closed until the next due to waiting on counts, etc. The user system must be ‘Elite’ and the accounting program must be Intact or Microsoft Dynamics. This will only affect real time GL postings, not end of day batch totals. Below we have outlined what is meant by transaction open date and transaction close date.</p>

<p> </p>

<ol><li style="font-size: 11pt;">Transaction open Date: refers to the Contract Out Date or Event Beg Date (if Party)</li><li style="font-size: 11pt;">Transaction Close Date: refers to the date the contract close action was taken, not a date in the contract form. Close Date can be seen in Transaction Edit of File Maintenance ---&gt; Transactions.</li></ol>

<p> </p>

<p>This is set on the accounting tab in Store 1 and applied to all stores.</p>

It will be blank while the Transaction is open.</li><li>If using Review Billing, the &#39;Revenue&#39; date field will be set when the Transaction is put into review billing and will not change when the Review is finalized.</li><li>If the closed Transaction is reopened, the &#39;Revenue&#39; date field will be cleared.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Transaction&#39;s &#39;Posted to Totals&#39; report does not use the &#39;Revenue&#39; date. It will still show totals posted on the date of the activity that caused the posting.</li><li>The Transaction&#39;s &#39;GL Entries&#39; list will show the &#39;Revenue date&#39; as the Trans Date on entries related to posting income. The &#39;Revenue date&#39; is not used on entries related to receiving cash. Those entries will still show the Trans Date being the date of receipt.</li></ul>
