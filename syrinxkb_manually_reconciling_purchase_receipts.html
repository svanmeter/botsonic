If you do not plan on entering a purchase invoice against a purchase receipt and wish to clear it from the list of items to reconcile when entering purchasing invoices. You need to query the purchase receipt in Syrinx SP\Purchasing tab\Query Receipt and then click the &quot;Mark as Reconciled&quot; button at the bottom of that screen.
