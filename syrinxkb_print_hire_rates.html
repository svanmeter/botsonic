If you would like to print a list of your hire rates, you should click on the &quot;Categories&quot; button in the &quot;Setup&quot; area of the Syrinx SP\Fleet tab. This will display a list of the hire categories that have been entered on your system. Select any of the categories in the list and press the &quot;Show Detail&quot; button at the bottom of the screen to open the &quot;Amend Hire Category&quot; screen. If you then press the &quot;Print Hire Rates&quot; button at the bottom of this screen and then select the &quot;All Categories&quot; option on the subsequent &quot;Print Hire Rates&quot; prompt, the system will print a list of all of your hire rates.
