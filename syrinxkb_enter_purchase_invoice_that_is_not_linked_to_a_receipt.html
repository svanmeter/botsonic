<br>If you need to enter a purchase invoice for a supplier that is not linked to any purchase receipts/orders on the system, you can do this via Syrinx SP\Purchasing\Enter invoices and then selecting &quot;Enter New&quot; from the &quot;Enter Purchase Invoices&quot; menu. If there are any purchase receipts for the supplier listed on the subsequent &quot;Enter Purchase Invoice - Pick supplier&quot; screen, you do not need to select one to continue and can simply click the OK button. This will then take you to the &quot;Enter Purchase Invoice - Pick Items to Reconcile&quot; screen. If there are any purchase receipts listed on this screen, do not tick the &quot;Rec?&quot; option against any of the lines and simply click the OK button at the bottom of the screen. The system will then issue the following message: <br><br>You have not selected any purchase receipts for reconciling with this purchase invoice. You may manually enter a purchase invoice (that does not have a corresponding order/receipt). Do you want to continue anyway? <br><br>Click Yes to this prompt and the system will open a blank purchase invoice for the supplier on which you can enter the purchase invoice info. <br><br>
