If you receive the following error when first attempting to connect to the Syrinx database from a client PC: <br><br>Unable to connect to server: Login timeout expired (-2147467259) <br><br>But, then Syrinx connects successfully on the second attempt. You should check on your Syrinx database server that the appropriate firewall ports have been opened/enabled in order to allow access to the SQL database engine from across the network. Once the appropriate ports have been opened or program access granted to the SQL server executable, you should be able to connect on the 1st attempt without issue.
