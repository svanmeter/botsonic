<br>If you are attempting to confirm a purchase receipt and are receiving the following message: <br><br>Assertion failure - &#39;SProc Error: server error 8115 at location spPrcConfirm/190 (Arithmatic overflow error converting expression to data type datetime.)&#39;. <br><br>Location: <br>THP06.cmdConfirm_Click <br>lbDbRunStoredProc(spPrcConfirm) <br><br>This means that the Average Purchase date on one of Items being receipted is set to a date in the future. To correct this, you should query the item in Amend Sales Stock Items (for sales items) or Amend Hire Stock Items (for bulk hire items) and then click on the &quot;Accounts&quot; tab of the stock item record and amend the &quot;Average Purchase Date&quot; value for the item so that it is no longer a date in the future.
