<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you would like to amend emails generated from Syrinx before sending them to the end recipient for purposes of verifying/amending the email content or attaching additional files, the privilege &quot;Prv.Admin.Can Amend Email Before Sending&quot; will need to be linked to an existing user role linked to your login or a new role will have to be created that contains that privilege and then that role linked to your login. If you are using Outlook and you have this privilege linked to one of your user roles, the system will then issue the following prompt when sending emails: <br><br>Do you want to send the email immediately? <br><br>If you reply &quot;No&quot; to the prompt, a draft email will be opened in an Outlook which can then modify before sending. </span></span>
