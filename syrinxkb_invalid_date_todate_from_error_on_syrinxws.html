Sometimes, when a Customer is logged in to your website (SyrinxWS) they may get an error when they are trying to query something with a date range. The error will read something along the lines of: <br><br>&#39;The Value for &#39;Date To&#39;/&#39;Date From&#39; is not a valid date.&#39; <br><br>Usually this will only occur if the &#39;Day&#39; value is larger than 12. <br><br>This can be caused by their browser settings not being set to United Kingdom format, but American format, where the date is actually being read as MM/DD/YYYY. <br><br>Below lists the different ways to rectify this for the 3 main browsers; Internet Explorer, FireFox and Google Chrome. <br><br>Internet Explorer <br>- Load Internet Explorer, and then press &#39;Alt+T&#39; on the keyboard, This will bring up the Tools menu. <br>- Select &#39;Internet Options&#39; from the menu that has appeared. <br>- The Internet Options window should open, and at the bottom there is an &#39;Appearance&#39; section.
