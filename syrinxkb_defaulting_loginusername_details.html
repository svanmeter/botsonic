<br>Syrinx remembers the login details of the last successful login using the connect database screen. So when starting Syrinx if you only get the small &quot;Logon&quot; screen which only displays the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Password&quot; fields, press &quot;cancel&quot; to bring up the full &quot;Connect Database&quot; screen and then login with the user that you want it to remember. Then next time you login the small &quot;Logon&quot; screen will default the user name to the user you used.<br>Â
