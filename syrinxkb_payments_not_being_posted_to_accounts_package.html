Payments have been entered in to Syrinx and the posting of payments to the accounts package is enabled but some payments are not being transferred. This can happen for several reasons. If the cash tills have not been reconciled since the last transfer, the system will not release any payments to the transfer tool until the tills linked to those payments have been reconciled. If you are not using the &quot;Process All Tasks&quot; option when running the transfer tool and are selecting the &quot;Post Sales Invoices..&quot; option only, this may result in deposit payments not being transferred as only payments linked to invoices that are being transferred will be processed. In order to verify that all payments are being posted, please run the &quot;Process All Tasks&quot; option on the transfer tool. <br><br>
