<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;">Dispatch Center - Truck Details</span></h1>

<p><br>From within Dispatcher Center, select a vehicle from the populated list and right-click to display vehicle details.<br><br>This screen enables the user to enter specific information about a truck including size and weight restrictions and GPS assignment. From Dispatch, right-click on a truck and select `Truck Details’. From this screen, the user can assign a default driver, enter specific GPS information and enter details about the truck.</p>

<p>The system uses the weight and size specifications when deciding if a specific load will exceed that particular vehicle&#39;s limitations.</p>

<p>For mapping considerations, the user can set whether they would like this particular vehicle to avoid highways or toll roads.</p>

<p>The user can also take the truck in and out of service by selecting the “Status” Box. Taking a truck out of service will separate it from your other trucks in dispatch so that whoever is routing knows exactly what vehicles are available for a specific day’s routes.<br><br><img alt="image.png" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DH5Q&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM4u000001rwN5" style="width: 525px;height: 565px;"></img></p>
