Select Verify Invoice.<img src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK8&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GWEj" alt="Invoice Receiving in Purchase Orders_639x341"></img></li><li>The user can also navigate to the ‘Options’ drop down and select ‘Verify Invoice’ which will bring up a search screen.</li><li><img src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK8&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GWEk" alt="Invoice Receiving in Purchase Orders1_664x201"></img></li><li><img src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK8&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GWEl" alt="invoice Receiving in Purchase Orders2_764x257"></img></li><li>Once the user has selected the purchase order, a list of line items will appear. Enter the total amount of the invoice into the ‘Invoice Amount’ field. Compare the line items of the invoice from the vendor to the line items of the purchase order and check them off as they match. There is also a select(all) deselect (all) chatterbox in the column header. If something doesn’t match, hit the ‘Reject’ button. This will mark the invoice ‘Rejected’ and it will show in that tab on the Purchase Order grid so that it can be corrected. A rejection reason and the operator rejecting the invoice can be selected from the drop down menus. The operator that rejected the PO will be listed in the rejected PO tab as one of the columns.</li></ul><p> </p><p><br></p><blockquote><p class="ql-quote-block"><img src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK8&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GWEm" alt="invoice receiving in Purchase Orders3_883x299"></img></p></blockquote><ul><li>If all of the amounts match, the invoice section will become active. Enter the invoice number, date and invoice due date to render the purchase order eligible for export. Invoice numbers cannot be duplicated for a specific vendor. If the user has filled in term days on the vendor, the due date will automatically calculate. Any invoice information entered here will be saved and reloaded each time the screen is opened.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><img src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DHK8&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001GWEn" alt="invoice Receiving in Purchase Orders4_982x331"></img></li><li>For users with integrated API accounting packages, the purchase order will be exported to the accounting service once the invoice is verified without further action from the user.</li></ul><p><b>Invoice Variance </b></p><p><br></p><p>There may be instances where the received invoice from the vendor does not match the closed purchase order. The user verifying these invoices may not necessarily have the ability to modify purchase orders over a certain amount, for example, if their max purchase order amount is set at $500. At this point, they would have to stop and find someone with the appropriate max po amount to fix the purchase order so that it could be verified and exported. This is where purchase order variance comes into play. </p><p><br></p><p>Variance can be set as a percentage (ex. 0.10 = 10%) or a whole dollar amount (ex. 50.00). </p><p><br></p><p>If the user tries to modify/write a requisition or open purchase order, they will be restricted to their (ex.) $500 purchase order max.  </p><p><br></p><p>If they modify a CLOSED purchase order, the variance will be taken into account. For example, they will be able to modify a purchase order worth $1000, but only within their variance limit. If their variance is set at 10%, then they can make adjustments up to $100 without the system stopping them. </p><p><br></p><p>Variance can be set differently for regular purchase orders vs subrental purchase orders.</p><p><br></p><p>To set variance, go to the search at the top of the launchpad and choose ‘Operator’. Search the operator and select the correct user. Variance will be located on the security tab.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p> </p>
