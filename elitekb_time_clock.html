<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Some states charge over time based on set hours in a day versus the number of hours per week. To charge hours overtime based on the day, you would need to change the hours your Parameter&gt;Printing Tab&gt;Time Clock Report. Change the Regular pay hours to 8 hours, Non-double time pay hours in a day to 12 hours, and Regular pay hour in a week to 40 hours</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Adding Entry – </span></b><span style="color: #333333;">You can add an entry by clicking on the red “</span><span style="color: red;">MISSING</span><span style="color: #333333;">” and you will be asked to enter the clock In/Out time. Or you can add by clicking on the ADD button. In this case, you will be asked to select the employee and then enter the correct date and time. If you are correcting an employee’s time, ALWAYS start fro the morning and go to the afternoon. In other words, start from the first time they missed for the day and go the last entry they missed for the day. Any entries that have been added will be displayed in YELLOW. On the printed timesheets, and added entry will say “added” next to the entry.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Delete Entry</span></b><span style="color: #333333;"> - You can only delete time clock entries that are marked in yellow. Double click on the entry and you will be prompt to delete the entry. You will have to manually enter the correct time for the employee.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Missing Entry</span></b><span style="color: #333333;"> – If the entry shows as missing, you can manually enter the employee time. You will need to select the employee and date, then you can enter the correct time.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">Clearing Entry</span></b><span style="color: #333333;"> – When the Time Clock, the report is run without selecting “include cleared entries”, a prompt will be asked to clear the entries when finished with the report. Clearing entries does not delete the time clock entries. It just marks those entries as being completed. The report can still print out timesheets with cleared entries by clicking on “ include” cleared entries.”</span></p>

<p style="background: white;margin-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18.75pt;"><span style="font-family: &#39;&quot;verdana&quot;, sans-serif&#39;;color: black;">•</span><span style="color: #333333;">Note: The system keeps track of whether you are clocking In or Out based on the number of time clock punches per day. So if you forgot to punch out of lunch, the computer will think you punched out for lunch when you were really coming back. To correct the error, simply go into Time Clock Scheduling or view your time entries under Counter System and click on the red “</span><span style="color: red;">MISSING” </span><span style="color: #333333;">for that day. Then enter the time you left for lunch. The computer will fix the In and Out times.</span></p>
