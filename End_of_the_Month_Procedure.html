<p>It is strongly recommended, that if your End Of Day falls on the last day of the MONTH and you are <b>not</b> opened, that you run your End Of Day on your last OPEN business day. This will help prevent you from having to do an End of the Day on the first day in the new month. You will need to change your calendar maintenance to reflect which day is the last open business day.</p>

<p>Please go to your Calendar Maintenance and make sure your end of the month is set to the last open business day. Click here to see how to set up in Calendar Maintenance, under <a href="/articles/en_US/Knowledge/Special-Days-469723815" target="_self">Special Days. </a></p>
