If you are unable to confirm a contract because the system is issuing the following message: <br><br>Delivery xxxxxx/2 has no items included on it. <br><br>You will need to check the &quot;Delivery Summary&quot; tab of the Enter Hire Contract screen to verify that all items have been allocated to a delivery. If all items have been accounted for, you should then check the delivery note number mentioned in the error message in the &quot;Multiple Deliveries&quot; section of the &quot;Delivery&quot; tab of the hire contract. If that delivery is genuinely not required you can simply select it and then press the &quot;Delete&quot; button to delete the entry. You should then be able to confirm the hire contract. <br>
