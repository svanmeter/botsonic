<br>The Syrinx client installation has been become corrupt or a component is missing. This is normally resolved by verifying that Microsoft 2002 Access Runtime (version 3 of Syrinx only), Microsoft 2010 Access Runtime (version 4 of Syrinx only), Crystal Reports XI runtime and SyrinxPDF printer driver are all installed. If any of these components are missing a full Syrinx client install using Client Install.exe (version 3 only http://www.syrinxusers.co.uk:443/Syrinx%20Releases/Current/Client%20Install.exe username: download password: c0nc3pt) or SpV4Setup.exe (version 4 only http://www.syrinxusers.co.uk:443/Syrinx%20Releases/Current/SpV4Setup.exe username: download password: c0nc3pt) should replace any missing components and resolve the error.
