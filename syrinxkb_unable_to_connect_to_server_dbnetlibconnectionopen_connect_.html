Unable to connect to server: [DBNETLIB][ConnectionOpen (Connect()).]SQL Server does not exist or access denied. (-2147467259) <br><br>This error normally indicates that either the Syrinx connection details are incorrect or the PC cannot connect to the server over the network or the appropriate ports have not been opened on the database server’s firewall. In order to verify the connection details, you can check the settings on an existing Syrinx client by going to Help\About in Syrinx SP and clicking on the “Context” tab of the “About Syrinx SP” screen. The server and database names should be listed on that tab. A full stop “.” or the the term “(local)” should be replaced with the actual database server’s computer name. <br>If the connection details are correct, you should then verify that the PC can connect to the database server on the network by pinging the server, browsing to the server. If you are unable to establish connection to the server by either of these methods, you could attempt to ping or connect to the database server using its IP address instead of its computer name as name resolution may not be working properly on the network. If you are still unable to establish any sort of connection to the server, your IT administrator should verify that the PC has been linked correctly to your internal network and can communicate with other computers on the network. <br>If you can access the server on the network, you should then verify that the connection attempts are not being blocked by a firewall. You should enable exceptions on the firewall for the SQL server service and also the SQL Browser service as inbound access to SQL server is not configured by default when the SQL database engine is installed on the server.
