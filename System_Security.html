<p><b style="font-size: 12pt;font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notes about special rates and proper use:</span></b></p>

<p><b>Setting Special Rates</b> - If you have set your parameter to require a password for price change AND you have set your parameter to NOT require a password for Special Pricing, then any time you try to change a price, you will be given the Special Rate option (exception: if double clicking the Price Each field in a contract you can manually set the price with the correct password level). If you set your parameter to require a password for price change AND you have set your parameter to require a password for Special Rate, then you will be prompted for the password to change the price.</p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> To prevent users from creating situations where the program must recalculate the rate of a line item and cannot due to a manual price override. In this case, the program will default to use the rate structure defined in the item record. This becomes a problem when the quantity is changed, an item is returned early or late, a continuation bill is generated, or any other circumstance that would cause an item to be re-rated. This is also important if you are doing any rate analysis and need to know the rate structure used to calculate the final rate.</p>

<p><b>Recommended Setup:</b> Set the Price Override Tracking to level 1 and Set Special Pricing to None. This provides the greatest level of protection from inaccurate rates.</p>

<p>The selections for the Security tab are as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="System Security 2_760x561" src="https://por.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka04u000000DIIP&amp;feoid=00N0L000006oGFU&amp;refid=0EM0h000001FH8I"></img></p>

<p>The selections for the Security tab are as follows:</p>

<p><b>Hours Override Tracking</b> - This parameter determines when override tracking for modifying item hours is recorded on the daily transaction summary. The second section determines the minimum password level that is required to make the change. This setting also affects rain hour tracking/security. The selections are 1. Owner’s level password, 2. Regional Manager, 3. Store Manager, 4. Assistant Manager, or 5. Key counter’s password.</p>

<p><b>Due Back Override code</b> - This parameter determines when override tracking for modifying the item due back date and time is recorded on the daily transaction summary. The second section determines the minimum password level that is required to make the change.</p>

<p><b>Max Price Change</b> – These options allows you to set the maximum price change that is allowed with each password level. If you put $5.00 under No Password, then a counter person would be able to change a line item price on a contract from 0.01 up to 5.00 without entering any password. If the counter person tried to change a line item by $6.00, then they would have to enter a password. If the password level allowed at least $6.00 price change then it would be allowed. If it was under $6.00, the request would be denied.</p>

<p><b>Require Operator Id for Overrides</b> - This parameter determines which level of password is required to allow an override when a sales item has insufficient quantity for the current sale.</p>
