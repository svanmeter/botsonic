<strong><span style="font-size: 36px;">Mass Update Pricing Agreement Rates</span></strong><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The menu option “Update Pricing Agreement Rates” in Syrinx SP Configuration\Administration tab can be used to update hire rates on pricing agreements by a percentage amount. In order to access this menu the menu access “Cfg.Hire Setup.Update Pricing Agreement Rates” will need to be added to one of the roles linked to your Syrinx login. Once you have access, you simply select the customer and the system will then pull through their agreed rates and you can either update them manually or increase them by a percentage. You can either select the specific rates manually or use the “Select All” option and then “Apply Pct Increase” to increase by a percentage. You can then close this screen down and come back and review it later or you can press “Apply All Changes” to sync down the updates to the live agreement. These updates will not affect any open or unconfirmed contracts that have been created for the customer. </span></span>
