<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_71x11.png"></img> We are listening! Items with this label are a result of your suggestions in uInnovate. Please continue to share and support those ideas that help your business.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Resources/Images/ReleaseNotes1_15x15.png"></img> We recommend reading these and understanding the impact prior to updating. These features may require adjustments to security or configuration and may have implications for your operations or current workflows.</p>

<p><b>Subrental Contract Links:</b> In the past, when a contract with a linked subrental was continuation billed, we prematurely set the contract link in the next contract with the corresponding next contract in the subrental continuation cycle in anticipation of that being the next step. However, we are now only updating the contract link when the subrental is actually continued. Otherwise, the previous subrental contract in the cycle will be left linked. We did this to make it easier to track oversights and to eliminate confusion that could be caused by contract numbers that do not actually exist yet.</p>

<p><b>Quantity Overlap Store Selector from an Item:</b> The quantity overlap screen (Item Record&gt;Analysis&gt;Quantity Compare Analysis&gt;Quantity Compare) from the item record has been enhanced with a store selector. This is useful so that data from each store can easily be analyzed instead of on the company as a whole.</p>

<p><b>eSign Error Messaging:</b> We have enhanced some of the messaging around certain ensign errors to indicate whether the issue lies with the PDF or the eSign server itself. This will help get those cases resolved in an efficient manner.</p>

<p><b>Memory Lane Monday:</b> This is a fun corner where we republish release notes from previous sprints you may have forgotten about.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_71x11.png"></img> <b>Discount Codes:</b> Users now have the ability to mark discount codes inactive. This will remove the discount code on customers and their future contracts, but leave it on already existing contracts.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_71x11.png"></img> <b>Credit POs:</b> Invoice information from the original purchase order will no longer be carried over to any credit po created off of it.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotes/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_71x11.png"></img> <b>Dynamic Sales Items:</b> Users can now utilize the item record type of Rental-Dynamic Quantity for sales items. Simply add sales items only to the package items, and the item will calculate the quantity of the package based on the sales item quantities.</p>
