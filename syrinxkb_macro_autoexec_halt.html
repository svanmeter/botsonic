If you receive an error message similar to the below when starting Syrinx: <br><br>Action Failed <br>Macro Name: AutoExec <br>Condition: True <br>Action Name: Runcode <br>Arguments: TH_AutoExec() <br><br>This issue can occur if one of the Syrinx components is missing such as the Crystal reports XI runtime or the SyrinxPDF printer driver. If you do not see these programs listed in the windows&#39; &quot;Programs and Features&quot;, you should rerun the Syrinx installer on the PC in order to add these components back on to the system. This issue can also be caused by a corrupt access runtime and you can remove the existing &quot;Microsoft Access Runtime 2010&quot; installation from &quot;Programs and Features&quot; and then rerun the Syrinx installer on the PC in order to add the runtime back on to the system. <br><br>In one instance Syrinx was looking for a windows MDAC component named msado28.tlb in the below location: <br><br>C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\%ADO%\msado28.tlb <br><br>But, the file was actually located in the below location: <br><br>C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ADO\msado28.tlb <br><br>In that instance the registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{2A75196C-D9EB-4129-B803-931327F72D5C}\2.8\0\win32 needed to be edited and the correct path to that file entered against the registry key. <br><br>**Always take great care when editing the Windows registry as improper updates can potentially harm your PC and it may fail to restart.
