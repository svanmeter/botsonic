<p>*Note: Any labor costs will be zeroed out when added to the contract as it is non-standard to capitalize these against an item. If the labor item is not zeroing out, there is a purchase price on the item that will need to be removed. (You would never have a purchase price associated with a labor item).</p>

<p><br> </p>

<p>You will receive a notification about the cost of the repairs being added to the item.</p>
