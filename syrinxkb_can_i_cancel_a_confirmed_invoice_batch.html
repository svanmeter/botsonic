It is not possible to cancel a confirmed invoice batch. Confirming an invoice batch is an irreversible operation. Invoice batches should only be confirmed once all invoices have been thoroughly reviewed and printed successfully. Syrinx support will not be able to correct or cancel any invoices contained in a confirmed batch. The only detail of a confirmed batch that can be modified is the “Invoice Date” that has been printed on the invoices. This date can be changed using the “Correct Date” button on the “Invoice Batches” screen in the Syrinx SP\Invoicing menu.
