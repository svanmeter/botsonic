<br>If you need to change the delivery addresses available when creating purchase orders, this can be accomplished via the Purchasing\Company Delivery Addresses menu. Address can be added by navigating to the last blank record on the &quot;Company Delivery Addresses&quot; screen.Â <br><br>Addresses in this screen are linked to specific depot records. So, if an address needs to be available to more than one of your depot records, the address will need to be added multiple times and linked to the specific depot records.
