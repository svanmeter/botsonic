In most instances &quot;Closed&quot; service jobs can&#39;t be reopened and the only thing that you can really do with them is to amend the parts/labour costs on those jobs as long as the system privilege &quot;Prv.Admin.Amend Costs on Confirmed Fleet Jobs&quot; has been linked to one of the user roles linked to your Syrinx login. If you have that system privilege, you can query the closed job in Query Service Jobs and then double click on the &quot;Cost&quot; value of a part to amend its unit price or double click on the &quot;Hours&quot; entered against a labour entry to amend the number of hours worked.Â <br><br>The one exception to reopening a closed service job is if it is a customer service job and it has been set to invoice in batch but a batch has not yet been created/confirmed that includes the service job. In that case, the job could be sitting in Syrinx SP\Workshop tab\Customer Jobs section\To Be Invoiced. If you find the job in this screen, you can use the &quot;Unconfirm&quot; button at the bottom of that screen to place the job back in the list of open customer service jobs.
