<br>If you are using the &quot;Amend Customers - Enter Search Criteria&quot; screen and the system is opening any records returned by the query in the &quot;Query Customers&quot; window meaning that you can not edit the customer record, check your syrinx client to see if you are running Syrinx 3.33.1. If you are, then it is more than likely that your database is actually running 3.33.0 and you will need to either reinstall the Syrinx 3.33.0 client or upgrade the database to Syrinx 3.33.1.
