You can create pricing agreements for new customers that are copies of an existing pricing agreement. In order to create the new agreement for a customer, you simply need to open the Customer&#39;s record using the Amend button in the &quot;Amend&quot; section of the Syrinx SP\CRM tab. Once you have identified the customer record, you should press the &quot;Pricing&quot; button at the bottom of the &quot;Amend Customers&quot; screen. This will create a new pricing agreement for the customer if the customer is not already linked to an agreement. You can then use the &quot;Copy From&quot; button on the bottom of the &quot;Amend Pricing Agreement&quot; screen in order to copy over any agreed rates/sales prices/discounts from an existing pricing agreement.
