If you are attempting to confirm a document such as a hire contract, offhire note, advice note, service job, stock check, etc and you receive a message similar to the following &quot;Assertion failure - &#39;SProc Error: Assertion Failure &#39;Individual or Disposed Stock Number&#39; in &#39;spSkiAdjustQtyInStock&#39;&#39;, you will need to check the sales items linked to whatever it is that you are trying to confirm and verify that all of those items are still current and have not been disposed. This can be accomplished by querying the items in Syrinx SP\Stock\Amend Items and then click on the &quot;Disposed&quot; tab of the stock item record to verify if the item has disposal details entered against it. If the item has been disposed, you will need to use the &quot;Make Current&quot; button to make the item current again so that you confirm your document. Once you have done that, you should dispose of the item again so that it does not get added to any further hire contracts, advice notes, etc.Â
