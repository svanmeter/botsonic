<h1><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Mass Deletions</span></span></h1>

<p>The Enterprise software stores customer and item history for years. when you delete customers or items, you lose a certain amount of detailed information. Even though a customer hasn&#39;t rented from you in five years doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t need his information. For example, you might be interested in customer income trends by ZIP code for the last five years. If you have deleted the customer from your system you don&#39;t know how much income or what ZIP code he was from. The same is true for items that you have sold. You might be interested in item category trends over the last five years. If you delete all of the sold rental items, your information will not be correct. For these reasons, we do not publish to do mass deletions of your data files. IfÂ you deem it necessary to mass delete any of your database files, please give our technical support staff a call and they will guide you through the process.</p>
