<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><br> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Computer hardware can be susceptible to failures caused by internal and external forces like fires or faulty hardware. Investing in a reliable data backup service can prevent data loss in such situations.  At Point of Rental, we always recommend siding with caution. As the saying goes, “It&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.”</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;">We<span style="color: #333333;"> recommend a minimum of two backups.  One should be an on-site full system backup and the other should be an off-site data backup.  The off-site data backup will predominately be used in cases of a disaster,.i.e. flood or fire, destroying all computer and server hardware.  Both Carbonite (formerly known as Mozypro) and Azure are good off-site backup solutions that allow your</span> data to be stored online. <span style="color: #333333;">An example of an on-site full system backup is utilizing Windows Server 2008 R2/2012 Standard’s built-in bare-metal backup called Windows Server Backup.  It is included with the Windows operating system thus no additional cost except for an extra hard drive to schedule as the backup target. </span></p>

<p style="background: white;"> </p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">The entire server recovery can take from a couple of hours to days depending on the severity of the hardware failure or disaster.  The most important thing is having a good data backup ready to restore once you get the new replacement server hardware. </span></p>
