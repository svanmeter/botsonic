<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you would like to enter additional &quot;customer call types&quot; for use when recording the details of calls to customers, this can be accomplished via the Syrinx SP Configuration\General Setup\Reference Lists menu. If you select the &quot;Customer Call Types&quot; option from the &quot;List:&quot; drop-down at the top of the screen, you can then add additional entries to the bottom of the list. After adding new entries, users may have to log out and log back into the main Syrinx program before the new entries will be available when adding new customer calls onto the system.</span></span>
