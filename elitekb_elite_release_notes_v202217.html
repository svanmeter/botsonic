<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotesEL/Content/Resources/Images/EliteReleaseNotes1_15x15.png"></img> We recommend reading these and understanding the impact prior to updating. These features may require adjustments to security or configuration and may have implications for your operations or current workflows.</p>

<p><b>Translation Speed for Browser Users:</b> Some of our users operating in a language other than English, may have noticed a decrease in speed due to incongruous language settings fighting for dominance. We got our elves to take a peek at that and rev up the horsepower on Santa’s sleigh. The result? Faster load times and less exasperation.</p>

<p><b>District Availability:</b> Contract processing has always had an option for No, Store, Region, or Company Availability display when calculating quantities on the Avail column. Since the restructuring of store groups to include Districts, it only makes sense that we have now added that option here. It can be set as the default on the Display Tab in Parameters if so desired. The District used will depend on the user and what stores are assigned to them. For example, the North Pole may have a greater inventory of reindeer, but the South Pole is the place to go to get your penguins.</p>

<p><b>POR One Images:</b> Users of the POR One app can now see images ingested from the app in the attachments tab of the record. They will appear as a list of non editable URLs. Clicking on the URL will open the image.</p>

<p><b>Public API - Bulk and Serialized Sales Records:</b> The API now allows users to add sales inventory (both bulk and serialized) through the endpoint.</p>

<p><b>Universal Search:</b> The universal search in browser will now include archived contracts to give a more complete set of data, no matter the age of the contract. This brings the universal search one step closer to omniscient (kind of like Santa)</p>

<p><b>Contract Creation from Browser Customers/Items:</b> When a contract is created from a customer or items within browser, the user will be shown the New Contract form with all contract options. The customer or item will carry over onto the new contract automatically.</p>

<p><b>Rental Revenue (7 Days) by Sales Rep Widget:</b> A new widget option has been added to the Sales dashboard. The values will filter on the sales rep set in the dashboard and will be based on the customer sales rep set in the contract.</p>

<p><b>Discount Amount:</b> In the past if a user had applied a discount percentage to a line, they would only be able to enter a discount amount for the value of the line after the discount percentage had been applied. Users can now apply a discount amount for the whole undiscounted value of the line. This is useful for scenarios where the user is trying to render the line to 0.00 without having to remove the percentage first.</p>

<p><b>Translations:</b> The Sugar Plum Translation fairy has visited the Maintenance Reports.</p>

<p><b>Memory Lane Monday:</b> This is a fun corner where we republish release notes from previous sprints you may have forgotten about.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotesEL/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_68x11.png"></img> <b>Item Exchange History Report:</b> We have added a report so that users can identify when and why exchanges are happening and address those areas to decrease the numbers of machines exchanged.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotesEL/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_68x11.png"></img> <b>Credits and Related Contracts:</b> Credit contracts created from a specific contract will now be listed in the Related Contracts list available from the Reports menu option from within a contract.</p>

<p><img src="https://help.point-of-rental.com/ReleaseNotesEL/Content/Resources/Images/uInnovate_68x11.png"></img> <b>Purchase Orders and Related Contracts:</b> Purchase Orders created from a specific contract will now be listed in the Related Contracts list available from the Reports menu option from within a contract.<br><br><br><br><br><iframe frameborder="1" scrolling="auto" allowfullscreen="" height="360" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781926754?h=5d2e967670" title="vimeo-player" width="640"></iframe></p>
