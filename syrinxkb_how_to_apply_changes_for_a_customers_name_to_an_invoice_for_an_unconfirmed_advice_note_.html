<br>If you create an unconfirmed advice note for a customer and create the invoice for that advice note, the system will not display the correct customer name if the customer&#39;s name is later amended via the Amend Customers screen. This is because the customer&#39;s name is snapshot against the invoice when it is created so that you do not end up with a paper copy invoice that is now different from the invoice that exists on the system. If you have not issued a paper copy invoice to the customer, you can get around this restriction by temporarily reassigning the advice note to a different customer, reprinting the invoice and then reassigning the advice note back to the correct customer and reprinting the invoice.
