If you attempt to run a period end and you receive a message similar to &quot;There are non-batch invoices dated on or before the period end date that have yet to be posted. These must be posted before you can run the period end.&quot; this means that you have confirmed invoices in your system that are dated prior to the period end point that you are attempting to create but these invoices have not been posted to the accounts package. Users will frequently also close down the corresponding period in their accounts package in conjunction with running period ends in Syrinx and the system is trying to keep you from getting in a situation where you have invoices in Syrinx that you can longer post to your accounts package as they are dated within a closed period. <br><br>To resolve the issue, you can simply attempt to run the Transfer tool to see if this posts any of these older invoices to the accounts package. If you are still unable to run the period end after this, the issue could be related to unpaid cash invoices and your system not being set to post unpaid cash invoices. You can get around this by temporarily enabling the &quot;Post Unpaid Cash Invoices&quot; option on the &quot;Accounts Transfer&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Accounts and setting a value in the &quot;Post To Date&quot; field equal to the period end date that you are trying to create. Then, run the transfer tool and the system should attempt to post any unpaid cash invoices dated prior to the &quot;Post To Date&quot; that you have set. The invoices will still be sat in the Unpaid Cash Invoices list in Syrinx and can still be marked as paid at a later date. This process simply posts the invoice transactions to the accounts package. After completing this process, try again to run your period end. If successful, reverse the changes that you made in &quot;Accounts Transfer&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Accounts. <br><br>**If you use &quot;Cash Accounting&quot; as your accounting method, you may wish to speak with your accountant before performing this process as they might not want these unpaid transactions in the accounts package. If they do not want you to run this process, you will have to wait until all unpaid cash invoices dated prior to the period end point are paid and posted before you can run the period end <br><br>**If you use &quot;Standard Accounting&quot;, you may want to leave the &quot;Post Unpaid Cash Invoices&quot; option enabled as you should only have that setting disabled if you use &quot;Cash Accounting&quot; as your accounting method and you could potentially be under-reporting your VAT liability <br>
