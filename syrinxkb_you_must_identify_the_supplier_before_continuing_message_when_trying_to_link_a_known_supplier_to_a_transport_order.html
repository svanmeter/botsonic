<br>If you cannot find a supplier when entering a transport order and you are certain that this supplier exists in the Syrinx database, you should verify that the supplier has been enabled for transport orders. To do this, query the supplier in Syrinx SP\”Customers/Suppliers”\Amend Suppliers and then once you have found the supplier’s record, click on the “Transport” tab and enable the “Supplies Transport?” option. In some cases this issue can be a result of the supplier not being available to the user’s depot. Repeat the process mentioned above to query/open the supplier’s record, click on the “Depots” tab and either enable the “Can Use Any Depot?” option or add the user’s depot to the list of depots.
