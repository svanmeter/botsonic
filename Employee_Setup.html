<p><b>Application:</b> The counter person is trying to overbook an item, but does not have a high enough password to do so. His supervisor comes over to approve. In the past, the supervisor would use the store password and the overbooking log would show the counter person as the person overbooking. Now, because the supervisor identified him/herself, the log will show them instead of the employee.</p>
