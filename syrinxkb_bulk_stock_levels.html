The system does not take quantitys of a bulk hire stock item out of stock when those items go out on hire. They only come out of stock if they are sold, disposed or transferred to another depot. <br><br>If you set a value against the “Warn whenever a hire leaves &lt;=” option on the “Options” tab of Syrinx Configuration\System Options\Contract Entry, the system will warn you if you try to hire out more of a bulk item than the system thinks is available. <br><br>If the user does not have the privilege “Prv.Front Desk.Hire If Insufficient Bulk Hire Qty” in one of the user roles linked to their login, they will not be able to confirm the contract if there are not enough bulk items available. <br><br>There is also a “Bulk Availability” button at the bottom of the “Enter Hire Contract” screen that can be used to check the availability of bulk stock in relation to the start date/duration of the contract. The Hire Stock List also has a “Bulk Availibility” button that shows general availability of all bulk stock in a specific category.
