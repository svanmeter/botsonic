<p>There are two ways of doing this. The first requires the user to set up an item for each zip code in order to track revenue or frequency. The second allows the user to assign zip code charges based on zones but does not provide reporting for individual zip codes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Tracking Zip Codes Individually:</b></p>

<p>Allows you to charge a set price for delivery/pickups and track the revenue by zip code.</p>

<p>1. Add New Item</p>

<p>2. In the Key enter the zip code for the delivery/pickup.<i> * Note: make sure you put a pipe symbol | in front of the zip code.</i></p>

<p>3. Enter the Name, Description, and part No (if any)</p>

<p>4. Enter a Quantity of 99999</p>

<p>5. Select the type, category, and department. The type would be Sales Item, Category: Delivery</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Changing Contract’s Store With Delivery Item</b></p>

<p>There may be times when a user would like to go ahead and write a contract in their store but would like to send it out of another store. This can be done by selecting the appropriate delivery zone item when scheduling a delivery. These items can be set up just as the zones above, however, the home store needs to be set as ‘000’ and the current store should be set as ‘001’, ‘002’, etc….</p>

<p>If all of these delivery zones have the same zip code in the notes, the user will get a list of all of the applicable items after the delivery zip is entered.</p>
