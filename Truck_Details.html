<p>This screen enables the user to enter specific information about a truck including size and weight restrictions and GPS assignment. From Dispatch, right click on a truck and select `Truck Details’. From this screen, the user can assign a default driver, enter specific GPS information and enter details about the truck.</p>

<p>The system uses the weight and size specifications when deciding if a specific load will exceed that particular vehicle&#39;s limitations.</p>

<p>For mapping considerations, the user can set whether they would like this particular vehicle to avoid highways or toll roads.</p>

<p>The user can also take the truck in and out of service by selecting the “Status” Box. Taking a truck out of service will separate it from your other trucks in dispatch so that whoever is routing knows exactly what vehicles are available for a specific day’s routes.</p>
