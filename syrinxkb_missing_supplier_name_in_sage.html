If you receive and error message similar to the below when running the transfer tool: <br><br>server error 515 at location spTHA19 sup update\100 cannot insert the valve NULL into column SUP NAME table <br><br>This normally means that the system is set to pull back new supplier records from Sage in to Syrinx and one of the supplier records in Sage is missing a “name”. If you look in the supplier records in Sage and sort by the “Name” column, you should be able to see any supplier records in Sage that are missing a “name” value.
