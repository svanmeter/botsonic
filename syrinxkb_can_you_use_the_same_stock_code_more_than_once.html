Stock numbers whether hire or sales must be unique in the Syrinx system. If you are attempting to use a stock number for a new item and the system is issuing a message similar to the following, &quot;This stock number has already been used by an item&quot;, you will need to either renumber the existing item or enter a different stock number for the new item. If you cannot find any stock items on the system that are using the stock number you wish to use, please verify that you are searching for current and non-current hire\sales stock items. If the stock number is linked to a disposed\non-current item, that item can still be renumbered allowing you to reuse the stock number for the new item.Â
