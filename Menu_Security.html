<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"><span style="color: #333333;font-size: 10pt;"><b>Overview:</b> How to set Menu Security to limit access to the Program Menu or Counter Menu options by the terminal. Certain Program Menu options such as Security, Configuration, or Analysis Reports should probably be limited to terminals used by management and not counter or warehouse terminals where they don’t need this access.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;margin-top: 5.75pt;"> </p>

<p><b style="font-size: 11pt;">Additional Security</b></p>

<p>A new security structure has been added to a couple of areas such as Purchase Orders, Vendors, and Venues. This will allow you to define access to a feature by Company, Store, Employee Group, or Employee.</p>

<p>Before Menu Security can be set, you must set up the User Profile for each terminal so it will be recognized. At each terminal, open POR and go to #1 Counter System – Input your ID – Tools (top left-hand corner of the screen) – Print Setup. Set the appropriate printers and Click OK. When the message “Update the Default Settings?” choose NO. Click OK and this terminal can now have it&#39;s Menu Security defined.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Creating Menu Security:</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">1. From the Program Menu&gt; Security&gt; Menu Security</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">2. Enter the Owner’s Password</p>

<p>3. You can create 26 different menu options from A-Z (in the upper left corner of the menu scroll through the options using the up or down arrows). To the right of the letter there is a description field used to identify the Menu created (Counter, Bookkeeper, Shop, Warehouse, etc.). There will be default menu settings such as “B Counter Terminal”, “M- Master”, “R -Receivables” and “S- Store master” as examples. Create as many levels as you might need.</p>

<p>4. You have a tab for the Program Menu, Counter Menu, and Day at a Glance listing the program options on each. The boxes to the left of the program descriptions will either be checked to allow access to the program or unchecked to stop access to that program at each level.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Assigning Menus to Terminals</b></p>

<p>1. In the box to the right labeled “All Terminals” will be listed all terminals that have been defined (If a terminal is not listed, then the printer selection has not been set or the “Update the Default Settings?” message was answered Yes). You can add a terminal to a Group by double-clicking the terminal in the “All Terminals” box; you can remove a terminal from a Group by double-clicking the terminal in the “Terminals in this Group” box. When this terminal opens Point of Rental they will only have access to the options you have checked in the Menu Security.</p>

<p><b>Assigning Menus to Operators</b></p>

<p>An operator can be assigned a specific menu allowing them to log into any terminal and have access to all menu options allowed by that operator. An example would be an operator with Menu security set at Master could log in at a very restricted terminal and have access to all options on the Program or Counter Menu. When he/she logs out, the terminal will revert to the default menu selections set for that terminal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">1. From the Program Menu&gt; Employee Setup.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">2. Select an Operator, then change the MENU option from DEFAULT to the menu of your choice. If left at DEFAULT the operator will have access to the terminal&#39;s default menu settings.</p>

<p>3. Click OK to save the changes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Logging In:</b></p>

<p>On the Program Menu, in the bottom left corner, you will see LOG ON. Click on that, type in your ID, and press Enter. The menu options will change to the menu assigned to the operator. When you are finished at this terminal, you can either click on login again forcing the next person to log in with their menu security settings, or close the program menu and reopen it to reset it to the default menu for the terminal.</p>
