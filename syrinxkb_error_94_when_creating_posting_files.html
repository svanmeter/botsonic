<br>When creating posting files in syrinx, you can sometimes receive the below error message: <br><br>Error 94 Invalid Use Of Null <br>Location: (THA19.exportsalesinvoices) <br><br>This is most commonly caused by a missing nominal code on one of the invoices that is being exported to the posting file. If you attempt to create the posting file again, the progress bar will normally display the last invoice number that it was attempting to export when it encountered the error. If you query this invoice in the &quot;Query Invoices&quot; screen, you should check the invoice lines and verify if any of the chargeable lines on the invoice are missing a nominal code. If there is a &quot;View Line&quot; button on the &quot;Query Invoice&quot; screen you can press that and then assign a nominal code to the line. If there is not a &quot;View Line&quot; button, you will need to query the underlying contract, advice note or service job linked to the invoice and then note down the category code and stock number linked to the chargeable line. You can then either set the correct nominal against the item&#39;s Hire\Sales category or on the item itself via the Amend Hire Stock Item or Amend Sales Stock Items screen. This change should then filter down to the invoice line and you should then be able to create the posting file.
