<strong><span style="font-size: 36px;">Creating a mailing list for all Suppliers that do Cross Hires</span></strong><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you wish to create a mail list for suppliers that supply cross hire equipment, you can accomplish this using the same method that you would use for creating mail lists for customers. You would need to go to CRM\Mail Lists, select &quot;Add New&quot; at the bottom of the screen to create a new mail list entry, indicate that you are creating the list for &quot;Suppliers&quot; at the top of the resulting &quot;Process Mail List&quot; screen and then select the &quot;Add to List&quot; option at the bottom left of that screen. This will open the &quot;Add Suppliers to List - Enter Search Criteria&quot; screen on which you can then select the &quot;Cross Hire&quot; tab and tick the &quot;Cross Hires?&quot; option to indicate that you only want to return suppliers that are enabled for cross hire. Enter any other relevant criteria and then press the &quot;Query&quot; button to generate the list. You can then export the resulting list using the &quot;Export List&quot; button in order to create a .csv file containing the supplier information for use as a data source with a mail merge program such as Microsoft Word.</span></span>
