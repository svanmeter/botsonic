If you are unable to close the program, you can exit the program by ending the Microsoft Access process in Task Manager. To open Task Manager, you can either press ctrl+alt+del and select the task manager option or right click on the task bar at the bottom of the Windows screen and select Task Manger and highlight the program named Syrinx SP or Microsoft Access and then press the “End Task” button. <br>If you are using terminal services and do not have access to Task Manager in your remote session, you could simply log out and then log back in to your terminal server session and this might close the unresponsive program. Please note that logging out of a terminal server session is not the same as closing the terminal server window. You would have to click on the Windows Start button and select the option to log off or sign out. If the problem persists, your IT administrator might have to log on to the terminal server and end the msaccess.exe process that is linked to your terminal server session.
