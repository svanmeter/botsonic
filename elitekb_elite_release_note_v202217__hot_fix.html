<p><b>Enter Price Through Discount:</b> We are continuing to make price updates a smoother and more controllable experience for our users. Within the contract, changing either the discount amount or percentage columns will now result in a form where either of these options can be selected and adjusted. There is also now a third option labeled ‘Enter Price’. A user will only need to enter the price they want to charge for the line and the discount amount will be calculated automatically. The discount amount/percentage will validate based on the limits set on the individual operator. If those do not exist, it will fall back to the store settings on the accounting tab in parameters (for discount percentage) or the max price change for the password levels on the tracking tab of system security (for discount amount).</p>
