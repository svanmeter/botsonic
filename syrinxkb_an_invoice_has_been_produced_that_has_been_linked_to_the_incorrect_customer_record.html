Invoices that have been linked to the incorrect customer record in Syrinx can be corrected by querying the invoice in the “Query Invoice” screen found in Syrinx SP\Invoicing menu, clicking on the “Details” tab and then pressing the “Re-Issue” button. The user will be prompted to pick the correct customer record and then will produce a credit advice note to credit the incorrect customer and will also produce an advice note for the correct customer which replicates the original invoice charges. Both the credit note and advice note will then need to be confirmed/invoiced by the user. The “Re-Issue” button will only be available to users whose logon has been linked to the “Invoicing.Re-issue Invoices” system privilege.
