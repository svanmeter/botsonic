<br>If you want to sort the Unconfirmed Advice Notes screen according to the delivery dates set on the advice notes, you should click the &quot;Del Date&quot; tick at the bottom of the Unconfirmed Advice Notes screen. The system will display the advice note&#39;s delivery date in the &quot;Note Date&quot; column, if it is present, otherwise it displays the advice note date and then sorts by that value.
