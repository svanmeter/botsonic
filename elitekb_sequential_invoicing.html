<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;font-family: sans-serif;color: rgb(59, 62, 65);">For certain organizations, it is useful to have a unique invoice number for each posted contract separate from the unique contract number.  To enable this option, check the box in the accounting tab of parameters, ‘Use Sequential Invoice Number’.  Enabling this will also turn on adjustments for account and cash customers and disable the ability to turn them off.</span></p>

The next number file will also be updated to reflect this.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
