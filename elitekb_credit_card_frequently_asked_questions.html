<p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;background: white;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: &#39;&quot;calibri&quot;, sans-serif&#39;;color: #333333;">Gateways fees are service fees set by credit card gateways.  A credit card gateway is a hub for managing credit card authorization requests and relaying back the result.  Gateway fees are not to be confused with processor “fees” or credit card rates.  A merchant’s credit card rates are negotiated with a processor or merchant services provider. </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;background: white;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: &#39;&quot;calibri&quot;, sans-serif&#39;;color: #333333;">It is important for a business to receive their credit card funds in a timely matter.  Credit card batches are settled daily.  Albeit some processors may fund transactions in a shorter time, they do so by incurring higher risk which can be passed on to their merchants in the form of assorted higher credit card rates and fees.  Funds usually reach your deposit bank account within 2-3 business days of the transaction.  The waiting period, known as the “time to funding”, varies depending on the time of day you enter transactions, which financial institution you choose for your transactions to be deposited in, and how long it takes your bank to verify and process electronic deposits.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;background: white;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: &#39;&quot;calibri&quot;, sans-serif&#39;;color: #333333;">Refunds can take 2-14 days to fully process.  The waiting period, known as the “time to funding”, varies depending on the time of day you enter transactions, which financial institution you choose for your transactions to be deposited in, and how long it takes your bank to verify and process electronic deposits.  Due to fraud prevention amongst parties involved in a credit card transaction, refunds can take longer than sales.</span></p>

<p style="background: white;"><b><span style="color: #333333;">What if my credit card bank deposits do not match my general ledger (GL)?</span></b></p>

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">Credit card integrations do not replace regular manual reconciliation between the general ledger and credit card bank deposits.  Regarding the settlement procedure, the integration ensures the total amount of credit and debit card transactions you processed matches what the credit card gateway will submit to your processor for settlement.  If the totals match, the settlement is submitted and the End of Day process continues.  If the totals do not match, an error occurs and you should call Point of Rental Support at (800) 944-7368 to troubleshoot.  Ensuring credit card payments are transferred from customer banks to the rental company’s bank account is outside Point of Rental Software’s justification thus outside the software support scope.  Contacting your accountant or credit card merchant services provider (ASP) is recommended.</span></p>
