If you are printing documents to PDF or emailing documents from Syrinx and the resulting PDF file is black and white and not in colour you should first check the SyrinxPDF printer object in Devices and Printers by right clicking on the SyrinxPDF printer object, selecting &quot;Printing Preferences&quot; and then verifying that the printer is set to colour on the &quot;Paper/Quality&quot; tab.Â <br><br>If the SyrinxPDF printer is set to colour but PDF documents produced in Syrinx are still coming out in black and white, you can try printing any document in Syrinx and then once the print preview is open, select &quot;Page Setup&quot; from the &quot;Report Print and View Options&quot; tab, then set SyrinxPDF as the specific printer for the document via the &quot;Use Specific Printer&quot; option on the &quot;Page&quot; tab and check &quot;Properties&quot; to verify that it is set to print in colour then click &quot;OK&quot; to close &quot;Page Setup&quot; screen. Finally, go back in to &quot;Page Setup&quot; and set it to use the &quot;Default Printer&quot; again via the &quot;Page&quot; tab of the &quot;Page Setup&quot; screen and then click &quot;Ok&quot;. Try printing the document to PDF again and verify if it now comes out in colour.
