If you are receiving the below error message when trying to connect to the Syrinx database: <br><br>Access is unable to connect to &#39;Syrinxdm&#39; database on the &#39;server&#39; server. Make sure that the database still exists and that the server is running&#39; <br><br>This usually indicates that the user account that you are trying to connect with has not been set up in the Syrinx database. You will need to verify that the user exists in Syrinx SP Configuration\Users tab\Logon Users and that a valid SQL login has been linked to the database user. If all looks correct on the user account, you can open the logon user record in the &quot;Logon Users&quot; screen and use the &quot;Reset Password&quot; button to try to reset the user&#39;s password. If any errors are received during this process which indicate that the login does not exist, you may have to use the &quot;Add&quot; button to the right of the &quot;Server Login Name&quot; field on the user&#39;s record in order to create a new SQL login for the user.
