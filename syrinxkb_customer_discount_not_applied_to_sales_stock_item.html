<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If a sales stock item does not have a &quot;Latest Sales Price&quot; defined against its sales stock item record, any discounts linked to that item via a customer&#39;s pricing agreement will not be applied when that item is added to a contract, advice note or service job. If you wanted to add customer specific discounts to these items, you must add a &quot;Latest Sales Price&quot; to the item via the &quot;Stock Item&quot; tab of the &quot;Amend Sales Stock Item&quot; screen which is accessed via Syrinx SP\Stock\Amend Items.</span></span>
