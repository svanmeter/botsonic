<p><span style="color: #2980b9;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>How to Enable and Use the Open Credit Card Payment Method</b></span></span><br><br>Performing an “open credit card” payment does NOT capture a payment.  Instead, it processes a $1.00 pre-authorization to capture a token for future use.  It proves the customer’s card has at least $1.00 available.  This form of “deposit” is riskier than taking a credit card sale for the deposit or capturing a pre-authorized amount because the cardholder is not guaranteed to have more than $1.00.</p>

<p>If using the “open credit card” payment option is a good fit for your business, you can enable it by:</p>

<ol class="ol_1"><li class="ListParagraph">Navigate to Program Files &gt; Configuration &gt; System Configurations &gt; Parameters</li><li class="ListParagraph">Click the <span class="span_1">Drawer </span>tab</li><li class="ListParagraph">In the <span class="span_1">Payment Methods Allowed</span> section, check-box <span class="span_1">Allow Open Credit Cards</span></li><li class="ListParagraph">Click the OK button to save and exit</li><li class="ListParagraph">Workstations must exit Point of Rental and get back in to begin using it</li></ol>

<p>From the contract payment screen, you will now see the <span class="span_1">R – Open Credit Card</span> payment method.  Please be aware the total payment always equates to $0.00 since no payment is actually captured.</p>
