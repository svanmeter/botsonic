<p><strong>Saved Search Filter Updates</strong>:  The behavior of the ‘Clear’ and ‘Cancel’ options has updated slightly when using saved searches within the browser interface.  ‘Clear’ will clear the filtered values, leave the filters and anything entered in the search field in place, and trigger a new search.  ‘Cancel’ will clear the search field and reload the previous saved search view.  If one does not exist, it will default to the ‘No saved search view’ option.</p>
 

<p><strong>Browser Security Navigation:</strong>  As a user scrolls up and down through browser security options (from browser configurations accessed through the gear icon at the top right of the application), the column header containing the labels (definition, version, etc.) will persist to allow users to quickly identify the information they are looking at.</p>
 

<p><strong>Rental Revenue Insights Widget:</strong>  There is a new widget on a sales type dashboard for Rental Revenue Insights.  This operates very much like the existing Revenue Insights widget, it simply filters it to only be for rental items.</p>
 

<p><strong>Web Quote Conversion:</strong>  A flaw was uncovered that allowed users with unified numbering turned on to convert a web quote from a quote to a reservation with the web quote customer still intacct.  It should prompt for an actual customer in the conversion.  This has been corrected.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Sales Item Transfers</strong>: This feature makes it easy to create a transfer for restocking bulk sales items between stores. When the transfer contract is written, the system will provide a list of available items that can be transferred from one store to another to satisfy items that are below their minimum at the receiving store.</p>
<br><strong>Asset Selling Items From Other Stores:</strong> Now, if the user tries to sell another store’s item on their contract, they will receive a warning that they are unable to do that. The items will either need to be transferred or sold out of the store they are in.
