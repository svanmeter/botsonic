If you would like to be able to remove the repair flag from an item in order to make the item available for hire but wish to leave the underlying repair job open for additional processing, you can do this by unticking the repair flag against the item in the hire stock list or by right clicking on the item at contract entry and selecting the &quot;Clear Repair Flag&quot; option. You should then be presented with a list of options: View Repair Job, Remove Repair flag but leave job open and Remove Repair flag and CANCEL the job. Selecting the &quot;Remove Repair flag but leave job open&quot; option will remove the item from repair but leave the underlying job open for further processing.Â <br><br>If you do not have the &quot;Remove Repair flag but leave job open&quot; option, you should enable the &quot;Raise Service Job when item flagged as &#39;Under Repair&#39;?&quot; option on the &quot;Fleet Servicing&quot; tab of Syrinx SP Configuration\System Options\Workshop. If the main Syrinx program was open while you made that change, you will have to close/reopen the program before that new option is available to you.
