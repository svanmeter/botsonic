The Oops message states: <br>You must use the &#39;Company Delivery Addresses&#39; screen on the Purchase Orders menu to set up a default delivery address for Purchase orders. <br><br>This means that there is no purchase order delivery address setup for the depot linked to the hire contract. You will need to go into the Purchasing tab and select the &#39;Company Delivery Addresses&#39; icon. The screen it opens shows each delivery record individually. If you press the &gt;* button at the bottom, it will give you a clear record in which you can enter the new company delivery address. <br><br>Make sure the delivery address is linked to the same depot as the cross hire contract. In some cases you may have the same address entered more than once in this list of records, but each for a different depot. <br><br>Once the address is added you should be able to go back to the contract and continue raising the cross hire purchase order.
