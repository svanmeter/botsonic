<br>If a service reminder is not appearing as &quot;due&quot; even though the reminder date falls within the &quot;Show Reminders due within next X days&quot; setting when running the service reminders report, you should verify that the item has been set as an individual hire item. This can be checked on the &quot;Stock&quot; tab of the &quot;Amend Hire Stock Items&quot; screen which is accessible via the Syrinx SP\Fleet tab\Amend menu option. If the &quot;Individual?&quot; tick box is not ticked against the hire stock item, the reminder will not appear in the service reminders screen.
